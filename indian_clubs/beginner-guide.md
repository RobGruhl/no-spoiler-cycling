## Getting Started

Indian club training is a time-tested method for building:
- **Shoulder mobility and stability**
- **Grip strength and forearm development**
- **Coordination and proprioception**
- **Core engagement and posture**
- **Rhythmic movement patterns**

This ancient practice combines physical conditioning with meditative flow, making it accessible to all fitness levels while providing profound benefits for modern movement deficiencies.

## Equipment Selection

### For Beginners

**Recommended: Rattan Clubs**
- **Material**: Rattan (technically grass, not wood)
- **Weight**: 1-2 lbs (0.5-1 kg) per club
- **Length**: Match your arm span (wrist to shoulder)
- **Why Rattan**: Lightweight, durable, safe, affordable

### What to Avoid Initially
- **Metal clubs** - Too heavy, can cause injury
- **Heavy wooden clubs** - Difficult to control
- **Clubs over 2 lbs** - Risk of joint strain

### Where to Purchase
- Check transcript files for specific retailer links
- Look for "expandable baton" alternatives (same length as traditional clubs)
- Local martial arts suppliers often carry rattan clubs

## Safety Guidelines

### Essential Pre-Training Setup

**Space Requirements**
- Minimum 6-foot radius clear space
- High ceiling (at least 9 feet)
- Non-slip flooring
- Remove breakable objects

**Warm-up Protocol (NEVER skip this)**
1. **Shoulder circles** - 10 forward, 10 backward
2. **Arm swings** - cross-body and overhead
3. **Wrist rotations** - both directions
4. **Light club swinging** - basic pendulum motions

**Proper Grip**
- Choke up slightly on the handle
- Maintain relaxed but secure grip
- Keep wrists neutral, not bent
- Switch hands regularly for balanced development

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Technical Errors
- **Wide swings** → Keep movements tight and controlled
- **Bent wrists** → Maintain neutral wrist position
- **Rushing tempo** → Master slow movements first
- **Poor posture** → Keep spine upright, core engaged

### Training Errors
- **Skipping warm-up** → Always warm up joints
- **Training only dominant side** → Equal practice both hands
- **Progressing too quickly** → Build foundation first
- **Training through pain** → Rest if joints hurt

### Equipment Mistakes
- **Starting with heavy clubs** → Begin light, progress gradually
- **Using damaged equipment** → Inspect clubs before each use
- **Training in cramped space** → Ensure adequate clearance
