low ceilings most houses in denmark at least have a ceiling height of 2.10 meters even that you know with a good clearance having the club in the progression of your arm might create issues as would be typical with the outer heart shaped swing done in the open style okay now what you don't want to do is just reduce your range of motion doing some kind of like lazy swing you know where the elbow is roughly shoulder level if you're going to do you know the engine club swinging to promote shoulder health you really want to get the maximum range of motion around your shoulder blade and that means elevating the elbow over the shoulder level you know at least with your ears okay now we can reduce you know the ceiling height by just going on our knees in the tall kneeling stance but what happens if you've got long gloves are you going to swing you know with the bare elbows or are you gonna choke on the clubs too i mean either way it's not really so good is it grab a box maybe even a bulgarian bag okay and now suddenly as you can see even i'm at the end of the handles it's no problem doing the swings yeah so let's try on the bulgarian bag as well i haven't tested this right but nice and soft for the knees no problem okay an alternative if you really have nothing in your house right we're doing the uh reverse nordic as i've done in certain videos now the only trouble with that by leaning back as the clubs cross in front of your body is because suddenly the club is not in this perpendicular line but it's actually coming at an angle yeah like this and now the weight instead of being in the prolongation of your arm it's going to be falling down that way so that can be a bit tricky you can do it with lighter gloves okay obviously if you've got the pala vandals you could switch to smaller bottles and fill fill them with sand so you've roughly got about a kilo in each club you know with a healthy little bottle okay other things that you can do so these are really good if you like especially if you're training in the garage all the things you can do is switching to the alternating heart-shaped swing and doing those in a wide stance by shifting your body away from the club so this is what it looks like boom so we are reducing the height because we're leaning away okay but i can still get that good extension and elevation so there's another strategy and then of course you could sort of like grab a chair and change your swing so here the problem is going to be when you get to the bottom you're going to smack your legs so instead you can do a wrist circle and get that good elevation bring them back to the side of the body wrist circle so you modify the swing by adding extra movements so you can sort of like at least get proper mechanics in this swing okay i hope the topic helps give you some insight and inspiration on how you can modify your club swinging so you can train anywhere anytime thanks for watching leave us a comment and we'll catch you in the next video [Music] oh\n\n\n## Endscreen\n    \n- [Indian clubs 102 Lesson 20/20: Heart shaped swings with an overhead squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCds7XhCXeQ)\n- [Indian
