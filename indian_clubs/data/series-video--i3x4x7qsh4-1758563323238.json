you can structure your training with a few basic exercise we're going to do a five minute circuit really no excuses right and if you've got more energy then of course you can repeat the circuit a couple of times and you could also consider changing the weight of the clubs each time you train the circuit now one thing to bear in mind when we're training with this open style of Club swinging and training with relatively light clubs the goal is on longevity and feeling good increasing your well-being and energy levels so one way to gauge if you're training has been correct for you is the way you feel after the training yeah if you feel better than you did before you start training then it's done its job that's it you don't need to do any more for today if by the country you feel a bit drained and tired or achy the following day as well then you've done too much that day so remember that and adjust the training correspondly so you'll be working on your Vitality your Mobility but you're building strength endurance at the same time just in a very slow but sustainable way okay so the circuit is 10 exercise each done for 30 seconds [Music] I've got my little timer here to set up and beat the first exercise is marching so we're going to start with the Feet Under right and we are already three two one and go boom so when you're ready you add the knee lift remember that we're working on opposite arm and leg to get the most of this brain training that we're doing at the same time if you want look at the back Club it's also okay to just look ahead find the stability remember no rushing I'm able to talk during this video because I've been training at a low level of intensity good next swing we're going to do a swipe followed by an overhead swing boom all the way up so swipe and then go all the way up really mobilizing the shoulders foreign whoops I did one more no problem and always adjust from here we're going to go behind the back so here boom engaging a chain of muscles we usually neglect behind the back really good to add those really good brain gymnastics at the same time getting that coordination Happening Here [Music] now I'm talking and Swinging doing too many things at once next order Crossing pendulum catch into an overhead lunge to the Y position and return to order [Music] we try to alternate The Crossing on the hands on each cycle remember to go to the depth that suits you that crawl so boom follow the club with the eyes try to keep the club in progression of your arm remember plenty of leg Drive side bending as well a little bit it's a little bit tough boom back to order Shield press back Circle Shield press back Circle yeah so we're really building the foundations for you to move better and become stronger and feel great oh order press to the flag and then swing into a squat and pull the bow swing back into place press in front of the body swing to the other side step pull the bow in that squat position [Music] so we try to time it catch into the bottom of our squat yeah small arm circles we reverse the grip arms out to the side smile yeah keep the knees nice and soft small circles five or so one way and then the other way and here we're adding an element of perturbation because the clubs are swinging and we have to provide extra stabilizations stabilization sorry while doing circles good grip now we're gonna do side to side swing but we're going to add a full circle in front of the body boom [Music] so it's a big big front Loop follow the club with the eyes use the leg Drive try to feel gravity pulling you yeah and last one is the reverse eight look at the club release the foot if needed to be able to twist side to side doing good guys and girls nearly done here you go try to stop my timer it's very enthusiastic that the circuit is over [Music]\n\n\n",
