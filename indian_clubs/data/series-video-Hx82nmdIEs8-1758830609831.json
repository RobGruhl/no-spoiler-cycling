  "transcriptText": "In this video, Thierry gives a clear demonstration of different tempo/ cadence while swinging clubs to a metronome.\n\nSwinging at a moderate speed will help your Indian clubs swinging skills, and avoid you bad habits. The rhythm of the swings should remain constant through the whole arc, no sudden acceleration and deceleration, which results in jerky movements, and a lack of flow.\n\nUsing a metronome or a drum loop in 4/4 time will ensure you control the swings and maintain a constant cadence from start to finish. This is important in the beginning stages, as sometimes if can look as the clubs are controlling the swinger.\n\nFor those into Persian meels, one criteria of judgement for competitions is sticking to the beat/ cadence set by the drummer.\n\nOur brains love rhythm repetitive patterns and  beats.\n\nRhythm is important for all athletic endeavors, not just dancing!\n\nIf you can't time your actions, you will miss the ball/ punch /fill in the blanks...\n\nAs for Tom Burrows record, after consulting with Conor Heffernan, Ph.D. (assistant Professor in Physical Culture and Sport Studies | Trustee of the British Society of Sport History) he could not provide answers as to the counting.\n\nWe both suspect that a heart shaped swing would have been counted as 2 revolutions, and possibly each hand counted separately. That would still be a crazy pace to maintain for one hour with 1,5kg clubs, let alone 100 hours!\n\nBy the way, after having judged kettlebell sport and kettlebell marathons events, I feel for the poor judges!\n\nTo learn step by step how to swing Indian clubs,\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD SWING INDIAN CLUBS\n\nGently mobilizes the shoulders, elbows and wrists and improve range of motion\n\nStrengthens the shoulder girdle and grip ( muscles and connective tissues) in its full range of motion\n\nConsists of compound movements in multiple planes\n\nProvides low impact cardiovascular exercise\n\nAssists recovery from intense training\n\nImproves the 3 pillars of physical literacy (body control , locomotion and object control)\n\nIt is fun and you forget you are training.\n\nThe

Tamil and Persian warriors.\n\nIndian clubs were used in Europe and USA for remedial gymnastics in the 18th and 19th century, by pioneers of physiotherapy.\n\n❂ READY TO LEARN MORE?\n\nAll our educational material has been tested and structured since 2010, in a way that is easy for anyone to learn from home.\n\nBest regards from Thierry & Ron\n\n[Music] hey it's there from export welcome to our channel so today i'm going to talk a bit about the tempo or the speed of execution when you're working with light indian clubs okay so those clubs here we're 1.5 kilos we've got the inserts in the handles yeah um of course the the weight of the clubs you're using is also going to affect the tempo that you're swinging with in general you should be swinging in a relaxed and controlled tempo a bit like if you're you know swinging through water instead of just going as fast as you can and free riding down the hill okay the most optional tempo for general praxis is roughly about 120 beats per minute so i'm gonna demonstrate four different tempos uh from really slow to really fast so you get a bit of an idea what it looks like if you don't have a metronome we're not using metronome for training just that visual reference of how fast it takes me to go through a cycle of the swing will help you i hope so 80 beats per minute is on the slow side for light british style club swinging fancy club swinging usually that's the tempo you would swing persian mills or heavier clubs okay but i'm gonna give it a go anyway to demonstrate the pace okay so here we can hear the beat one two three four go boom one one one one one okay so it gives you a visual reference of what being on the slow side is it's really good work you know if you're only light clubs and you want to focus a bit more on the actual strength endurance it's going to feel like a ton after swinging in this tempo for two or three minutes so recommended to try it as well so you should be able to hear that the tempo is picked up quite a bit we are at 120 bits per minute and even though it's faster for doing heart-shaped swings with light british style clubs or paladins with inserts um it's actually a relaxed controlled case okay so let's give it a go one one one one one one one one one okay so the key point when you're working with metronome is hitting the beat at the precious uh same time okay so my reference point out of the four 4 bit tempo is here one 160 beats per minute a relative fast space for swinging indian clubs let's try to time it so 160 beats per minute would really get my heart going if i was to do it for three or five minutes now i'm going to go to lighter clubs because i know i won't be able to keep up the pace 200 beats per minute that gets it going and finally 220 bits per minute whew so let's break it down tempos revolutions per minute and link it all to tom burrows who established one of the most amazing club swinger endurance feet ever in 1913 okay so if um we're following a 4 4 time 80 bits per minute that gives us 20 heart-shaped swings per minute 120 beats per minute 30 swings 160 40 swings 250 heart-shaped swings per minute and you saw that i couldn't swing with the uh 1.5 kilo per vandal had to go actually to half the size about 700 grams now tom burrows in 1930 did 100 hours of non-stop club swinging with three pound clubs so not pallet vandals but you know same weight 100 hours straight 80 revolutions per minute let that sink in 80 revolutions per minute i don't care what kind of swings he was doing even you know if he was doing muline at an insane speed to maintain 400 hours straight okay so yeah i hope you're gonna try swinging to the beat i recommend for beginners you know the main tempo you should you should concentrate on is 120 beats per minute it's nice and deliberate it's controlled you know it's a moderate pace now you also want to swing sometimes slower and sometimes faster okay you're really going to appreciate the cardiovascular demands that he would have taken to do 80 revolutions per minute with 1.5 club i hope they were counting you know each hands as a revolution so maybe he was doing 40 swings per minute uh but double up gave 80 revolutions i've got no idea that we don't have any records of how they uh you know um determined the the kuterium for the for the record apart from the the brief guidelines you can find on the internet okay if you got any information about the the record leave a comment if you try the exercise if you try swinging to the beat leave a comment remember to subscribe to our
