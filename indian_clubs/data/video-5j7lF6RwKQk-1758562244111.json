  "transcriptText": "Indian club training is a time-tested method for building shoulder mobility, grip strength, and coordination. Used by warriors, wrestlers, and athletes, it enhances joint health, endurance, and functional strength. Key movements like mills, circles, and swings improve flexibility while strengthening the wrists, forearms, and core. Great for martial artists, athletes, and rehab, Indian clubs help prevent injuries and boost performance. Start light (1-2 lbs), focus on fluid motion, and build strength progressively.\n\nThank you for watching! Please like, subscribe, and leave me comments!\n\nGo to pasquinilli.com to get updates and curriculum checklists and guides.\n\nand how it can create a lot of power in your grip your forearm your upper arm your shoulders this is one of the best ancient self-defense and ancient strength training tools you can possibly use going to have you start with one in each hand as you grip your Indian swinging club your pinky finger will always come to the center of the ball here on the end and kind of cut it through the middle and your thumb will be down you will not put your thumb there you could hurt your thumb thumb you're always going to wrap it and when you hold your Indian swinging club don't squeeze it but keep it in a firm grip so you hold one in each hand you're going to Simply warm up by letting them swing behind your back and then up above your head as you do this motion you're going to keep your belly up and in your abs are tight tuck your chin a little bit breathe in through the nose out through the mouth and your feet are going to come together your Heels come together and your toes Point kind of sideways they int like a duck so heels together toes out stomach up and in ABS tight tuck your chin breathe in through the nose out through the mouth as you do this opening move this first Power move your beginner Indian swinging club workout you're going to do this for about 30 seconds you're going to feel your heart rate start to rise it's going to really improve your overall Fitness it's going to help your posture this going to make you hit a lot stronger for self-defense it's going to make your blocking better it's going to make your grip better if you do Jiu-Jitsu hey Garen it's good to see you again you're holding make sure your thumb is down now I'm going to have you bend your elbows and then rotate your clubs going forward first let them drop to the ground that'll bring your palms up to the sky back behind the head nice easy orbital spin both hands at the same time if you want to get fancy you can alternate I like to do them with the same time going forward first do this for about 30 seconds and then reverse it pulling it back letting it go behind you warming up your wrists strengthening your forearms you're going to get power in your forearm power in your grip power for striking for self-defense improved Fitness less pain in your joints stronger shoulders stronger forearms painfree elbows just pulling back like that then you're going to go back to this swinging motion again put your heels together toes out stomach up in ABS tight as you go forward you're going to let the spin happen and go down then you're going to pull it in reverse and up so you're adding to spin down and spin up going to increase your flexibility dramatically you're going to really increase the speed and the power of all your strikes for self-defense as long as you keep your stomach up and in ABS tight tuck the chin breathing in through the nose out through the mouth heels together toes out comes a standing Core workout and again you're going to do this for a good 30 seconds you can go longer if you like this is a beginner power workout with your Indian swimming clubs nice and simple now I want you to split your grip get rid of the spin for a minute on this next exercise and what you're doing is you're allowing it to go back farther than when you swing them at the same time you swing at the same time you'll be limited in your range of motion but when you split you'll be able to turn your shoulders keeping this in the center of your body you're going to increase the range of motion really stretching both forward and backward you're G to feel it in your shoulders in a really positive way as you feel yourself getting stronger remember to keep your stomach up and in ABS tight heels together toes pointed out this is also going to raise your heart rate until you might start to sweat improve your circulation getting healthier as you're getting [Music] stronger after 30 seconds we're going to let that one rest I want to show you one modification I like you to do for leg strength when you are practicing to defend yourself whether it's a punch or a palm strike or an elbow strike any type of strike is all coming through the feet through your legs through your spine through your core through the shoulders out through the arm and then you hit them so you're hitting from the ground up when you throw in an air squat you're going to activate all the muscles in the core but also in your lower body especially when you push your hips back like you're sitting down into a chair you don't have to go that low especially if you Lo lost Mobility over the years but when you add the Indian swinging clubs in this power workout to that squat it's going to stabilize you in a way that allows you to go a little bit lower it's you're going to activate more muscle fiber you're going get a better range of motion you're going to strengthen your knees you're going to strengthen your glutes especially as you age men especially get weak in the glutes flabby butt looks like you're holding a file folder back there as your posture deteriorates and falls apart just cuz you're sitting all the time so you add these exercises in it's going to activate your glutes your big butt muscles all the punches that come off the floor go through those powerful glutes you stabilize those hips you be knocking people out for self-defense simply because you added in this power Indian club swinging workout this beginner workout add some of these air squats with this basic swing and each one of these weighs 2 lbs that's not a lot it's not going to wear you out it's not going to build big beach muscles but it's going to give you strength and real strength to defend yourself with simply by swinging these things two lbs is really all you need you can even start one pound or just a stick in each hand get a broomstick cut it in half that's your starting Indian swinging club you want to move up something like this I put a link in the description that's where I get mine you can see what they cost they're super inexpensive it's an entire gym in your garage you here it's starting to take my breath away now back to traditional Indian swing club exercise going to get your heels together stomach up and in ABS tight we're going to bring one uh Indian club up in this position so that your forearm is perpendicular to the ground pointing to the sky your knuckles are flat so it's not like this but it's like this from this position you're going to swing it back out and by swing it I mean Let It Drop and do its own work under its own weight pulling your arm out you're just going to do this motion on one arm 15 to 30 seconds I like you to do time instead of counting repetitions the number doesn't really matter the number of times so much as the amount of time you keep tension on the muscles so we call it time under tension we wanted that to be the guide as we get older instead of reps when you're 18 years old you get big bodybuilder muscles go for reps of five or eight or 12 or whatever the fat is whatever you're trying to accomplish but as you get older make sure you've got about 30 seconds in there before you move on to get the full benefit now once you've done that on both hands you're going to come to this starting position you're going to open your chest just by opening your elbow and then you're going to cast and you're not going to hit yourself in the back of the head as a beginner I worried about that as a beginner you don't have to worry about that because when you open your elbow that's always going to that's always going to put the club Behind Your Head then you're going to cast it like you're casting a fishing pole or throwing a knife just going to cast it Let It Drop open the elbow cast it Let It Drop let it come all the way through the center of your body remember these Knuckles this is very important Knuckles are facing the sky the elbow the upper arm or the lower arm is perpendicular perpendicular to the ground once you get that it's three motions here's one here's two the cast is three we say slow as smooth smooth as fast so you're not going to power it up you're not going to push it Forward you're going to let the power and the speed come from the smoothness of each one of those motions once you've done that 30 seconds focus on that other arm elbow cast there's a big storm brewing outside I don't know if you can hear the thunder yet it's getting closer caused a bunch of tornadoes up north we'll see what happens down here normally sunny suthern Florida it's darker than it normally is this time of day because the clouds are so heavy stomach up and in ABS tight breathing in through the nose out through the mouth keep your heels together turn your toes out like a duck once you've done that for 30 seconds on the other arm go back to your first arm focus on think about it and reverse the motion so Palm facing behind you turn the hand up bring the elbow across Let It Drop so same motion Just In Reverse again slow as smooth smooth as fast when you're ready allow yourself to speed up but don't push it I want you to do this 30 seconds every time once a day once every other day within a few weeks you'll be a master of the basics you'll get so much value out of these Indian swinging clubs bring it to the other hand turn it elbow across remember this perpendicular that it drop I see the comments coming in I'm apologize I can't read them this far back I want you to be able to follow this flow the flow of this workout so want to con walk forward to read comments but I'll go back and read them later appreciate you being here I appreciate your chat now once you've done that on the other side 30 seconds we're going to go back to the first hand and then we're going to chase it with the second hand so what that looks like is I'm going to come here I'm going to follow one with the other one stomach up and in ABS tight breathe in through the nose out through the mouth heels together like a duck toes out speed it up when you want to by the way there's no way to do these workouts wrong you'll just learn every time you do it you'll learn a little bit more until you get some basic level of proficiency then there's still always more to learn grow don't beat yourself up keep your ego in check you're not supposed to be good at it at first if you don't quit you'll be good at it eventually then just reverse it so bringing one out following it the next one comes the rain and then the third one they come in and out at the same time each time you do this one time you'll have one elbow or one fist in front of the other one the next time through put the other one in front keep your heels together here we go rain's dropping stomach an in ABS tight in the comment section if you're already using Indian swinging clubs just put how many pounds you're use pounds or kilograms my recommendation to start light one pound is enough after about 6 weeks maybe move up to 2 lbs slow as smooth smooth as fast take your time then switch it into the reverse now on the next workout we're going to throw in a sinal pattern coming from Filipino martial arts might throw in one or two and then the other thing I want to show you next time we work out together with these is getting more of the body and there's so many ways to use these Indian swinging clothes this is just the tip of the iceberg but I should say and if you learn how how to do this first and then this second and this third and I know I didn't teach him that word and then this fourth every once in a while you throw in some of these and then finally you learn how to do your Mill both alternating same time forward and reverse if you can do those you'll master the basics and you'll be able to teach anybody else and you'll feel the value the benefit in your shoulders in your elbows and especially in the grip and then all your strikes and if you fight with a cane if you fight with a stick if you fight with a knife all your strikes all your techniques if you punch if you grapple everything is going to be so much better because of the power of these beginner Indian clubs I think the rain I think we rained out I don't think we can hear I can't hear myself so um um if you have any questions put that in the comment section or if you have recommendations or you know a lot of you guys know things that I don't know about especially about things like this put that in the comment section let's create a dialogue in our um Community our virtual training Dojo put in the comment section are you using them already if you do what weight do you use wood wood feels so much better these these have been around forever though if you need a parot in the uh the description I'll see you guys on the next one thank you",
