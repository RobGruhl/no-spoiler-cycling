your Kel belt juggling so to make it easiest to catch the handle again when you make it flip you have to make sure that when you let go of the handle it's really in a neutral position so the handle is not at an angle the flip through the air gonna make it impossible to catch again so make sure that you release the kettlebell with the handle neutral parallel to the ground or perpendicular to the ground the next thing is that when you release the quelle Belle and make it flip you don't just want to make it describe a big movement right through the air through space you wanna make sure that that quelle Belle becomes weightless and spins on its own axis staying at the same height in the same distance from your body the swings are gonna use when you're juggling with Kelly bells it's quite different from a fitness swing or swing when you try to accelerate as much as possible here it's more kind of relaxed tempo and you're my swing in a different slightly different style that you usually do with the basic flips you have different progression options too to get family to throwing and catching again so it's going to be with two hands on the Cal bear then one hand then hand to hand and then eventually can also have one killer Belle in each hand the last thing when you're doing quelle Belle juggling and tricks it's also important to be uncomfortable with moving around and with the cowbell so it's good idea to practice may be walking swings in your warmup [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
