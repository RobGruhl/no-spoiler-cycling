  "transcriptText": "Today is day 2 of a new series to get you practicing and moving with your Indian Clubs a little each day.\n\nWe're having a look at Half Moons.\n\nKnow this movement by another name? I'm using language and terms taught to me by my coach/es.\n\nThe technique still applies whatever you call each move. I'm just happy to get people moving more with clubs/mace/their bodies. You can dive as deep as you like. I am here to help beginners and those who just want to do the thing and get moving. I love it.\n\nI'm using 1lbs poly clubs in this practice video.\n\nyou can learn about choosing your first clubs here -\n\nit's a little little practice today because it's a new skill all right so we're going to learn the movement and then you can practice as much as you need okay how do we know which is outward and inward think about the full moon all right my full moon drops from the top outwards if I'm doing a half moon I can keep going on this pattern it Dr drops then it slices halfway drops out slices halfway okay we're going to start add in a tea the mace is going to drop when I come to the end here I'm going to turn the mace Palm down at a right angle sorry turn the Club Palm down at a right angle so it's here and then I'm going to slice across okay so it drops down bend my elbow when I get to here across this way Hammer grip right slice it out so this would be an outward Half Moon cuz I'm coming in slicing out in slicing out okay try with the other side straight Palm down in Palm down flick the club to behind you slice it out down flick slice down flick slice let's try both together both arms out Palms down here saber grip down flick right see both clubs are pointing backwards now yeah then slice okay back to my te shoulders packed okay don't be holding up here shoulders packed drop in slice if you can remember change which hand which arm is on the top okay same thing for like when we do our hearts yeah we going to change which one's on the top and our moons same thing goes with half Moons I come out Palm goes up Club goes back okay then I pull my elbow in slice across I end up in this Bend time position I stretch out come to my tea back bend and slide SCE out back bend and slice okay let me show you the other arm here Palm up Club goes back right so here Bend and slice out back bend and slice out back bend and slice okay let's try both arms going inward so inward slice inward slice inward slice inward slice okay one of my favorite additions to the half moon is a helicopter wrist roll okay you know how I just said point the club back if you're going in slice and then down okay if you want to do a helicopter wrist roll the opposite applies so from the straight I'm going to go Club first going to bend my elbow Club goes close to me I let it go all the way around and I finish in the flick out then it drops tip goes forward rotate the hand drop it out tip goes forward okay let's try the other way the same thing applies so I go down instead of going back to slice if I'm doing a helicopter wrist roll I go forward that means Palm up forward let the tip curl let the tip curl move your arm and right at the end it flecks out okay in forward tip curls tip curls out then you get this real lovely kind of spin on it okay really fun let's try the other side so an inward first which means we're going to go drop in then smooth out drop in then smooth out because this would be a whole inward Moon so tilt forward Palm is down to do the helicopter wrist roll and finishes on and up let's go two hands at a time for your helicopter wrist rolls on a half moon start out first off we're going to do outwards so outward Moon yeah which means we're going to drop first drop first for the half moon helicopter wrist roll means we're going to go Palms up Palms up finish Palms down drop bend your elbows tilt the clubs forward Palms up finish straighten them out T squeeze your glutes stack your shoulders good okay drop again drop flick forward and out drop flick forward and out drop flick forward and out let's go inwards inwards we're going to do the wrist roll first then drop through tilt forward then drop through so Palms down clubs go forward in my hand Hammer grip first then I let them keep going as I bend my elbows let them keep going okay have a practice of that and let me know how you go have a good day",
