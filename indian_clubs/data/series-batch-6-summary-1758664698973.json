low ceilings most houses in denmark at least have a ceiling height of 2.10 meters even that you know with a good clearance having the club in the progression of your arm might create issues as would be typical with the outer heart shaped swing done in the open style okay now what you don't want to do is just reduce your range of motion doing some kind of like lazy swing you know where the elbow is roughly shoulder level if you're going to do you know the engine club swinging to promote shoulder health you really want to get the maximum range of motion around your shoulder blade and that means elevating the elbow over the shoulder level you know at least with your ears okay now we can reduce you know the ceiling height by just going on our knees in the tall kneeling stance but what happens if you've got long gloves are you going to swing you know with the bare elbows or are you gonna choke on the clubs too i mean either way it's not really so good is it grab a box maybe even a bulgarian bag okay and now suddenly as you can see even i'm at the end of the handles it's no problem doing the swings yeah so let's try on the bulgarian bag as well i haven't tested this right but nice and soft for the knees no problem okay an alternative if you really have nothing in your house right we're doing the uh reverse nordic as i've done in certain videos now the only trouble with that by leaning back as the clubs cross in front of your body is because suddenly the club is not in this perpendicular line but it's actually coming at an angle yeah like this and now the weight instead of being in the prolongation of your arm it's going to be falling down that way so that can be a bit tricky you can do it with lighter gloves okay obviously if you've got the pala vandals you could switch to smaller bottles and fill fill them with sand so you've roughly got about a kilo in each club you know with a healthy little bottle okay other things that you can do so these are really good if you like especially if you're training in the garage all the things you can do is switching to the alternating heart-shaped swing and doing those in a wide stance by shifting your body away from the club so this is what it looks like boom so we are reducing the height because we're leaning away okay but i can still get that good extension and elevation so there's another strategy and then of course you could sort of like grab a chair and change your swing so here the problem is going to be when you get to the bottom you're going to smack your legs so instead you can do a wrist circle and get that good elevation bring them back to the side of the body wrist circle so you modify the swing by adding extra movements so you can sort of like at least get proper mechanics in this swing okay i hope the topic helps give you some insight and inspiration on how you can modify your club swinging so you can train anywhere anytime thanks for watching leave us a comment and we'll catch you in the next video [Music] oh\n\n\n## Endscreen\n    \n- [Indian clubs 102 Lesson 20/20: Heart shaped swings with an overhead squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCds7XhCXeQ)\n- [Indian

tips that i share with you your swinging become a lot smoother and more fluid so let's get ready and get into it i want to make a case for new beginners to start incorporating more head movement more eye movement okay this stimulates your brain improves your balance and a lot of many other good things okay now if you're into the strict rigid military style club swinging where nothing moves and just the arms and the clubs that's fine okay just go and find another channel we don't teach that way we teach a more natural where the whole body is engaged when there is rotation happening right from your feet knees hips shoulders and head okay we stimulate the brain every time we rotate from side to side okay so if you've got balance problem that's the first step start moving your head as you're walking you're gonna find it kind of challenging okay the better you get at this everything becomes easier when it comes to balance and also when you're swinging clubs because you won't have to think about turning so much i mean once everything is coded in you know you can even close the eyes look straight ahead and you're going to move fluidly but you know from experience teaching new beginners this works so if i'm um swinging by the side of the body and i'm not doing much movement the clubs are moving parallel or in sync there's no need to look anywhere else i mean of course i can do it as an excise in itself yeah but what it becomes apparent is if the clubs move out of sync because now they're going each their way and instead of just being strict and rigid like that you just allow for the natural rotation of the spine so i'm going to look towards the back club on each rep okay a lot more stimulating for your brain than just looking straight ahead now if you're dealing with you know people that have some problems dizziness or whatever then you know it doesn't make sense so you sort of like get them to fix a point ahead for everybody else try this okay now if i'm using my hips you know boom again i want to keep the neck i want to you know everything lined up with my torso so i don't look like this and you can see my gaze is shifting okay i'm looking roughly two meters in front of me and then looking up so again eye movement head movement is happening here through the falling at the hips now when we're swinging in front of the body if it's a symmetrical pattern okay so be it this be it this there's no need for turning the head when we are doing asynchronic patterns turning the head and you can even overdrive it by you know offer and sizes look whatever word it is in english by looking over your shoulder okay so now i start the rotation through the spine here and i can assist the swing yeah boom so as in chronic clubs moving in the same direction like in a windmill or even a parallel heart-shaped swing okay boom parallel i look towards the club as i receive them against the body boom lift the elbow turn boom and facing the other direction okay so this turning of the head apart from stimulating your brain creating new pathways improving your balance it's also going to assist the often lacking rotation in the body that you need to perform a smooth swing okay so let us know in the comments if you find the tips helpful subscribe to the channel leave us a like catch in the next video [Music]\n\n\n## Endscreen\n    \n- [15

in this short video i'm going to tell you exactly what you need and how the whole course is going to unfold so first of all when people think indian clubs a lot of times they think about those short enlight clubs when the original indian club is more something like this so you can see a longer taller thicker heavier club and this is the adjustable version okay now for this course you know because it's instruction course you can use anything that you have just want to keep in mind that a very short clock like something like this that's also very light it's gonna make it really hard for you to actually feel the momentum in the pull of the swings and um you know it's not really recommended but of course you know you may do with what you have this is what you have now if you have a pala vandal right what i recommend you is to have a bottle filled up with water so a little bottle so you got a kilo a club weighing about a kilo and then try to see if you can have another bottle filled up with sand now if you're using sand a very good idea is to plug some kind of little silicone uh prop at the end so the sand doesn't tip out most importantly it doesn't get into the thread when you're screwing and screwing the handle okay so this is gonna work really well because this bottle here is about three kilos okay so at the end of the club you get a decent weight and leverage that's going to help you to actually feel the swings now some of the exercise we're going to do with two hands on the club like this so it's an advantage if you can screw the two parameters together you've got a longer club which is going to make it again easier for you to understand the mechanics of the swing cool so this is about what you need the other thing is of course a space where you can sort of like lift your arms above behind you without eating anything or anyone okay so just like a clotted free um area for training the daily sessions are about 15 minutes they include a warm-up you know most of the times and then we go straight into the exercises so it's gonna be a really nice and easy built up progressively so we go from very simple stuff to more complex stuff and by the end of day four you should be able to do the full swing which is called by some people the mill so we've got this swing in front of the body behind the body okay which is basically the signature move of indian clothes then on day five we put all the exercise together introduce some body weight exercise and we make it into a little short circuit training session for you to get a feel of how you can string all those exercises together to get an effective and fun training [Music]\n\n\n## Endscreen\n    \n- [Mugdar exercise workout (Mudgar /Clubbell) | Circular exercises with a
