terry from eric sport welcome to the channel so in this video today i want to show you a couple of knee over toes exercise we do with the indian clubs i'm going to show you a light club variation and a heavy club variation let's go so if you know little about traditional indian physical culture you know that the hindu wrestlers the khushi wrestlers perform an exercise called baitec which is basically a neo-toe squat okay so the heels are definitely off the ground the upper body is as straight or erect as possible knees definitely over the toes the hamstrings are resting on the calves okay and these are usually done with an arm swing and perform at high reps okay um so we're gonna use that model of squatting to combine it with the indian club so first i'm gonna demonstrate with the light clubs here using our power bundle that screws onto solar pop bottles okay whoa whoa whoa not so fast remember to subscribe like and leave us a comment so based on an outer meaning going away from the midline heart shape means we've got a back circle combined with the front circle okay so this is the swing and now as elevate the clubs i'm gonna drop into my squat okay so i've got an overhead squat if you've got problems coordinating the movement it's best to start in this position and then lower the arms as you raise up okay so as soon as they go behind you you extend the arm you descend into your squat personally i prefer to open my knees out it doesn't affect my gait okay i still walk my toes pointing forward uh i don't walk funny so don't stress about it okay so here we are boom get up descend okay and high speed and so on okay and you could even combine it with the snake you know many ways you can do this anyway on to the heavier club so heavier club swung with one hand okay i'm gonna actually this time have my inner swing boom like this and maybe change direction drop under the weight as i catch it with the straight arms in my overhead squat okay this is here boom as i get up because it's heavy club i bring it down to my guard position away from the body boom i go into my head parry and at the same time i drop under the weight so again you know maybe you want to start in this position first straighten up order away head parry drop under the weight okay so we got the club going up the body going down same kind of ideas if you're doing a barbel snatch for example boom and that's that hope you like the series and keep on swinging bonus exercise variation with the reverse nordic standing on your knees can you even see that i don't know so tall kneeling let's say okay i've got the top of my swing here if i go straight down i'm going to hit the ground not cool so as i the arms come down i'm gonna go into a reverse knee extension and straighten up again okay so here's another way where you can combine indian clubs and knees of a toes exercise [Music]\n\n\n## Endscreen\n    \n- [Mugdar exercise workout (Mudgar /Clubbell) | Circular exercises
