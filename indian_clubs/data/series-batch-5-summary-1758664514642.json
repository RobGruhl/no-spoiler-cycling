regards from Thierry & Ron\n\nterry from hero export welcome to the channel in today's video we're going to be talking about light british style indian clubs i'm going to give you three main points before you get started on your club swimming journey and how to pick a set that is perfect for you we're going to cover shape and design starting weight and length let's get into it [Music] when it comes to british style engine clubs we've got basically two types of shapes or designs okay the first one is the classical teardrop with the long handle short body and all the weight is distributed towards the end of the club so it's basically like a very short mace okay and then you've got the bottle shape now these two here are modeled after what's called the new york style it's got a longer type of handle compared to this one here you can see which is called the boston style with a stubbier look shorter handle okay so the weight distribution with those two clubs even though they're the same weight is going to be affected and be different okay so for that club you can see the guess the the middle of the body we're talking about the center of gravity is gonna be around here and this one is gonna be probably a bit further down okay of course they slide longer um you know but you sort of like get a bottle shape or tear drop now those little clubs here designed for kids or rhythmic gymnastic based after the teardrop okay you've got a very narrow handle a round knob basically uh they're great for what you're supposed to use them but if you're looking after a training method with indian clubs you'll be better through something else you know leave this to the kids now the knobs you can see how very round and they're specifically used for doing all type of fancy uh figures and swinging with the knob which is not really considered a really proper grip when it comes to indian club swinging yes if you're very fancy perfect so you know be aware what you want you want to be doing fancy patterns or do you want to mobilize strengthen your shoulders okay this has to be taken into consideration so if now we'll take a look at the paleo vandal with the three quarter litre bottle with a long neck you can sort of see the similarities between the teardrop shape and the way those clubs are going to handle okay so same weight 750 700 grams pellet vandals or wooden clubs and here we have the same equivalent for the pellet vandal and the one liter bottle now if you put the insert they actually go up to 1.2 which is also the same weight as our medium-sized indian clubs as you can see you can fit different type of bottles and you can even change the filler by using sand and here you've got a club that weighs just about three kilos okay amazingly this little bottle of hoisin sauce filled up with the lead shot also weighs three kilos last detail about the design of the clubs is the handle itself now something that is very thin is not going to be so nice to handle so we like to settle on a nice solid reasonably grip handle and this is the same handle diameter that we have across the clubs we sell this is a prototype although we have versions like the gamma and the xl and the tg they have a thicker diameter handle but purely speaking about british style clubs this is what we found after all the years we've been turning clubs is the best for most people a lot of people recommend half killer clubs to get started with indian clubs now of course it's always better to be on the safe side and start with a lighter club than rather start with a heavier club but the old textbook let us know the proper guidelines for starting off with indian clubs one kilo to 1.2 kilo for men and up to 750 grams for ladies in competitions in the victorian era in the early 1900s the regulation weight was 2 kilo per club for ladies and men if you want a really large set of clubs because you're afraid of injuring yourself you want to test the waters whatever reason or maybe you only want to do complex swinging then you should join a rhythm gymnastic club you know if you go to a store then you'll be able to pick up a set of these clubs for about 15 euros but you won't be getting the same benefits as swinging a set of proper indian clubs last tip about picking a set of indian clubs that is right for beginners okay you don't want something that is too short or too long so what's too short well obviously this is too short okay tip of your fingertips to the crease of your elbow if it's shorter than that the club is too short you won't feel the momentum here boom slightly longer perfect length now what is too long knuckles center of the hand to your armpit maximum length to start off with swinging indian clubs this club would be too long okay and what happens is that because it's too long you're probably going to end up bashing the clubs behind your head especially and you will going and you're going to cut off the range of motion to sort of like avoid the club's bashing so instead of properly ever elevating your arms as you launch the club you're going to elevate out to the side do a lazy type of swinging it's not going to encourage good practice so keep those tips in mind when you're selecting a pair of indian clubs remember with the paler vandal it's pretty much foolproof you've got the right length you've got the adjustable weight and you know the design by changing the shape of the bottles as well so check it out if you haven't done so we've got starter kits on our webshop otherwise you can also take a look at our uniquely designed and handmade clubs here in denmark thanks for watching see you in another video [Music]",

eric sport welcome to the channel in today's video i'm going to get run to show you how to take care of your wooden indian clubs i'm going to take you on a quick tour of our headquarters we got the office uh the training room here and then i'm going to take you to the workshop so this is the outside of our headquarters used to be an old apple farm let's get in first thing you have is the office and the uh you know the shipping area what you want to call it wrong side of the office my side of the office um and here we go in our little training area boom lots of stuff in here and the newly painted wall there we are and now i'm going to take you through those doors here and go to ron's workshop ron the show is yours everybody welcome to ron's workshop this is where everything happens and we're going to take you through a real quick how to take care of clubs and what we do before you guys get them first of all i mean before you do any job always have a good cup of coffee if you're going to use your soul make sure you've got something to just keep you calm our favorite in the house right now cardamom and a little bit of honey and coffee it's excellent the oiling process these are sanded with the different grains of sandpaper of course but now it's fine they're really nice and velvety to touch right now grab yourself some plastic gloves we use what's called the danish oil which is a blend of oils and natural other things when we put it on the club looks like this you can see i use a generous amount because it's really got to soak in now here's the thing let it sit a couple of minutes but i mean really it's it's not rocket science people this is what we do rub it all in good amount on the club make sure it gets into all the pores make sure it's pretty easy to see that all of a sudden there are no empty spaces everything's got a little bit of a coat then the one that's been drying for a few minutes soaking in you basically rip off your gloves stay in a well ventilated area nice dry cloth do yourself a favor get something that's used it's lost all its small little fibers so they won't hang in the pores of the wood and dry it off really good you can see that the shine basically goes from real glossy to a satin color it's really lovely to touch after this it's not slippery it will dry now or cure but that's how it's going to look so when you want to redo the clubs if you feel your clubs have dried out you know accident they've been in too much heat been in the sun all that kind of starting to get old you drop it whatever here's the beauty about using oil you basically don't have to re-lacquer the whole thing grab yourself some sandpaper but grab yourself i mean if you're just going to touch it up and give it a nice new shine 220 or even some fine steel wool take your these are dry now with just for experimental purposes or to show you what's going on lightly over the surface basically all you're doing is knocking off the fibers that have lifted because with our clubs the bamboo it stays pretty stable i mean you are not going to experience any cracking that type of things like you do in solid wood also one of the reasons why we choose to make the clubs out of this material so rub it all down take those microfibers off now you can see it's lost its shine and plastic coat it now you don't really have to let it dry too long because this has already got a good coat on it so it's basically you're covering the surface take your dry cloth rub it down oh and it's beautiful again and it's like baby soft now the oil that we use is a danish oil you can look it up if you can get it in your area it's fine it's cool it's basically a furniture oil but like in the description that we've got i think tara is putting in there are some that are better for the environment than others i mean you can see well ventilated but i mean everything drips in here so we've got no airborne lacquer and thinners and all that kind of stuff just keep yourself protected with plastic plastic gloves and well ventilated area it's a really fast process you can see i mean that was like lickety-split and that one was done again there's uh you can even i think the terry's going to include a old recipe for the traditional oils this is what we've got this is what we love this is what we get already pre-made up to all the ingredients it's a product we really really like and we like what it does to the wood finish like how it feels in the hands when you're using it and basically that's how you can uh treat your clubs if you feel they're getting a little dried out after a long time or yeah exposure to heat that's basically what it is in a nutshell thanks we'll see",
