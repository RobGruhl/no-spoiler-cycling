So this is the saber grip. When we come to wrist circles, then you have the option to do the wrist circle with a full hammer grip, or by using...\n\nthe ring grip. The ring grip, you simply release the last three digits and this\n\nor even behind the body, then we want a wider base of support for side-to-side\n\nstability. The same applies when we're swinging across, so horizontally, stay wide.\n\nAnd if we're doing cutting motions or figure 8s, then we want a narrow base to be able to pivot more efficiently. The knees must remain soft, so we're not\n\ntensing and squeezing and tightening up the legs. Remember we stay nice and tall, and if you have to bend, make sure that\n\nyou're bending with a straight spine, so all the bending happens from the hips.\n\nNice straight line, soft knees. Some of the\n\nwe are lifting the arms above the head so we want to try to maintain a short\n\ndistance (look at hands), instead of leaning back and putting pressure on the lower back.

Another important cue is \"Where the head\n\nlooks, the body will follow\" So it's important, as you're swinging, to maintain a visual contact with the clubs You don't have to follow right through up\n\nand down, but especially this side-to-side movement is important.\n\nIt's gonna allow your spine to nicely rotate, and we want to rotate from\n\nthe ground up, so the feet are probably gonna release if you could tight knees.\n\nSome people might leave the heels in the ground, but we turn from the knees, the\n\nhips, shoulders in the direction of the swing. And last principle or cue, is that\n\nas much as possible, we want to make club swinging a full body exercise, so no\n\nbreathing. We want to try to match the breathing to the type of movements we're\n\ndoing. So when we're swinging, we're not tensing up and not holding our\n\nbreath. As the arms or the clubs rise, we want to... breathe in, and as the clubs fall...\n\nwe want to breathe out. So the principle behind this type of thinking\n\nis that as the ribcage becomes freef of pressure, we can breathe in, it can expand.\n\nAs the arms come against the chest or we're bending forward, we create pressure\n\non the ribcage, and here is the right time to breathe out. if you're learning complex movements,\n\nsometimes you can experience a bit of frustration. So, as soon as\n\nyou experience this, take a break, come back to the movement later. It's always\n\nbest to practice in short focused blocks instead of saying I'm going to learn\n\nthis, right now, okay? That's a sure way to get frustrated and maybe stop swinging\n\naltogether. So short breaks, come back to the exercise later on, and might take a few days before some of the swings fall in place. If it's still too complicated,\n\nregress to single club swinging. Sometimes when we're trying to\n\ncoordinate both our arms, it increases the level of complexity, so just regress\n\nto a single club, maybe a lighter club, and also think of pausing in the key\n\npositions of the swing, so you can start to groove the exercise, and eventually\n\nyou're going to going to link repetitions all together. So we hope this\n\n101 express guide is helping you to get on the right track for club\n\nswinging, all the best with your training!",

We're going to look at the safety, the grips, the stance, and a few relevant cues that are necessary for efficient and safe Club swinging. So the first is safety. \nCheck the gear, no leaking, everything is held in place. Then we're going to take a space check. Out to the sides, and finally also above the head. \nMake sure your training area is free of clutter. Safety aspect number 3: YOU are the best and most experienced trainer in the room. \nSo listen to your own body. If it hurts, stop doing it. Remember that you can slow down the speed of the movements, reduce the weight of the club, or reduce the range of motion of the circles. Point number 2: the grip. You're going to\nslide the little finger, or your ring finger, all the way down the handle to\nrest against the knob. When the club is in this position, vertical, elbow in\nagainst the body, it is called the order position. Some exercises might start from\nhere, or it's a resting position. Other exercises might start down by the side of the leg, or even right above the head. This grip is called the hammer grip, yeah?\nYou may hold the thumb locked over the middle finger or the index finger, the\ngrip is firm yet relaxed. We're not trying to crush the handle to death.\nWhen the club is in motion, we're going to change to what's called the saber grip, so\nthe club is going to be in the prolongation of the arm... like this, so we want to have one straight line when the arm is extended and the club is swinging, yeah? So this is the saber grip. When we come to wrist circles, then you have the option to do the wrist circle with a full hammer grip, or by using...\nthe ring grip. The ring grip, you simply release the last three digits and this\nallows for more range of motion of the club around the wrist. Point number 3: the stance. When we're swinging by the sides of the body, we want to keep our feet right under our hips. When we're swinging in front of the body\nor even behind the body, then we want a wider base of support for side-to-side\nstability. The same applies when we're swinging across, so horizontally, stay wide.\nAnd if we're doing cutting motions or figure 8s, then we want a narrow base to be able to pivot more efficiently. The knees must remain soft, so we're not\ntensing and squeezing and tightening up the legs. Remember we stay nice and tall, and if you have to bend, make sure that\nyou're bending with a straight spine, so all the bending happens from the hips. \nNice straight line, soft knees. Some of the\nimportant cues in club swinging are: core engagement. This applies especially when\nwe are lifting the arms above the head so we want to try to maintain a short\ndistance (look at hands), instead of leaning back and putting pressure on the lower back. So as soon as your arm goes over head, make sure to engage the midsection. \nAvoid doing this type of movement. It also applies when we're lifting the elbow as\nwhen we're doing swipes or back circles. Another important aspect is to engage\nthe shoulder. So when we're swinging like this, back and forth, we want to avoid\nour shoulder, and our arm reaching forward like this. We want to maintain the shoulder in place:\ndown and back. so think: this is a short arm compared to a long arm, long reach. \nKeep everything nice and tight, close to the body. Another important cue is \"Where the head\nlooks, the body will follow\" So it's important, as you're swinging, to maintain a visual contact with the clubs You don't have to follow right through up\nand down, but especially this side-to-side movement is important. \nIt's gonna allow your spine to nicely rotate, and we want to rotate from\nthe ground up, so the feet are probably gonna release if you could tight knees.\nSome people might leave the heels in the ground, but we turn from the knees, the\nhips, shoulders in the direction of the swing. And last principle or cue, is that\nas much as possible, we want to make club swinging a full body exercise, so no\nstiff legs. We want to transfer the weight with a slight up and down motion, so we're using the knees and the hips to assist the swinging. 2 last points:\nbreathing. We want to try to match the breathing to the type of movements we're\ndoing. So when we're swinging, we're not tensing up and not holding our\nbreath. As the arms or the clubs rise, we want to... breathe in, and as the clubs fall...\nwe want to breathe out. So the principle behind this type of thinking\nis that as the ribcage becomes freef of pressure, we can breathe in, it can expand.\nAs the arms come against the chest or we're bending forward, we create pressure\non the ribcage, and here is the right time to breathe out. if you're learning complex movements,\n sometimes you can experience a bit of frustration. So, as soon as\nyou experience this, take a break, come back to the movement later. It's always\nbest to practice in short focused blocks instead of saying I'm going to learn\nthis, right now, okay? That's a sure way to get frustrated and maybe stop swinging\naltogether. So short breaks, come back to the exercise later on, and might take a few days before some of the swings fall in place. If it's still too complicated,\nregress to single club swinging. Sometimes when we're trying to\ncoordinate both our arms, it increases the level of complexity, so just regress\nto a single club, maybe a lighter club, and also think of pausing in the key\npositions of the swing, so you can start to groove the exercise, and eventually\nyou're going to going to link repetitions all together. So we hope this\n101 express guide is helping you to get on the right track for club\nswinging, all the best with your training!\n\n\n",
