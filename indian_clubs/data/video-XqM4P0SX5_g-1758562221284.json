of your body so you get a deeper stretch into those shoulders you're going to feel it in your upper arm feel it in your forearm you're going to feel it in your grip in your fingers your hand everything's getting stronger in your arms with your Indian swinging clubs as you get greater flexibility and health healthy shoulders stronger shoulders using this ancient Indian or Persian it's also a Persian there a Persian meal Persian exercise see a lot in Old School pictures military especially the British military we brought in the giras they're in India for a long time we learned from ancient warriors how to stay healthy and strong using what is essentially a levered weight so it's just a weight on a stick so most of the weight is here and the leverage means that even though it's just 2 lbs pulling against your hand against your arm this is why your arms are getting stronger stronger that levered weight adds up to more than just the 2 lbs now you're going to bend your elbows and rotate forward keeping your elbows bent close to your head you allow the clubs to rotate past your ears heels are still together toes out like a duck stomach up and in ABS tight Brea then through the nose forcefully out through the mouth then you're going to rotate in the opposite direction pulling them back you can see this is activating all the muscles in your forearm as you get a more powerful grip grip is a big part of stronger arms I use these to keep my arms and shoulders healthy I also use them to hit people harder for self-defense make your grab Ling better if you do Judo or Jiu-Jitsu or Western wrestling or Eastern wrestling so you 30 seconds in each Direction and you're going to go back your heels together to your swinging motion and this time as you come down you're going to spin out as you come up you're going to spin in the opposite direction so up comes back down goes forward stomach up and in out it's tight you're starting to get a good sweat this is a whole body exercise while you strengthen your arms you get stronger arms with your Indian swinging club workout old school old man strength old woman strength it's how you stay healthy and vital as you get older stay safe from injuries your other workouts remember to suck your gut up and in keep your abs tight now we're going to do a very traditional swinging exercise this is called a mill going to start with this about hitching a ride make sure your thumb is sideways and not up don't ever put your hand on the side of your stick whether it's this stick or if you fight with sticks having your thumb on the stick think you're going to run into something you can break that bone right there so make sure your hands closed your palm is facing behind you then it comes up by bending your elbow as it swings up again you're going to let the weight of the Indian swinging club bring your arm back now open your elbow and cast so three motions one two this third one is like throwing a knife or casting a fishing pole you can cut it down to three motions once you start to get it let it get smooth that smoothness will bring speed you can repeat the Mantra slow as smooth smooth as fast remind yourself take your time with the weight the Indian swinging club do the work as you build stronger arms healthier shoulders after this hand for 30 seconds you're going to bring this one in warming up with this easy simple motion first this is the most important part of this motion facing sideways a lot of times when we work together I see you do this you turn your thumb up make sure it's here and then when you're going through it looks like this you're pulling your hand back so make sure you're here open cast slow as smooth smooth as fast take your time heels together stomach up and in ABS tight tuck your chin breathe in through the nose forcefully out through the mouth get your heart rate up getting healthy and strong stronger arms Indian swinging clubs you want to see the dimensions of my Indian swinging clubs these Persian meals check the link below in the description buy a pair there very inexpensive or make your own or you can start with a hammer I like a rubber mallet you can get up like 24 o 16 to 24 o usually they're 10 to 15 bucks at the hardware store or the do-it-yourself store get two of those and then work your way up to a fancy Indian swinging club and you can go heavy too heavy is a different kind of exercise but we can go over that later now after you've gone out with both arms I'm going to have you come in so instead of here and here we're going to go here bend your elbow bring your hand across think about shielding the body come across here Let It Drop the weight pull your arm bend the elbow Shield the body and notice that you're bringing your hand not to here and down but you're coming across your Center the center line think about your spine the spine's in the center come through your spine don't be spineless that's silly joke just bringing it out Bring it through after 30 seconds here go back to the opening motion with your other hand once it's out bend it across slow smooth smooth becomes fast fast becomes strong and powerful stronger arms swinging club once you've done both arms in the reverse you're going to go back to that forward motion you're going to follow one with the other one stomach up and in ABS tight tuck the chin breathe in through the nose out through the mouth heels together toes turn out like a duck slow as smooth smooth as fast all reminders so you get better form better workout you get stronger arms and get

swinging club exercise for stronger grip especially stronger arms from your shoulder to your fingertips everything's stronger it's also a full body exercise your heart is going to race a little bit as you raise the core temperature in your body you're going to sweat you're going to breathe more deeply more completely it's going to engage all the muscles of your body it's going to improve your posture so you look younger you look leaner you're going to get stronger uh Na says love your videos appreciate you being here I really appreciate that good uh positive feedback please in the comment section if you would in the comment section not just the chat let me know are you training already with Indian swinging clubs and if so did you make your own like I started are you using sticks do you have something like this this is the lowest or something like that they change names all the time just from Amazon these are inexpensive are using hammers I sometimes we use hammers we're going to do a lot more grip strength training in the near future to work on that forearm as we redefine what it means to be strong and fit not just for overall health but also for self-defense and I want you to be able to hit hard and if you grab a hold of somebody I want them to feel it you know I want you to have a powerful grip we can get that using a lot of levered Weights this kind of stuff uh silent walk good to see you um but let me know in the comment section are you already working with these if you are what weight are you working and uh my recommendation always is to start light and work your way up if you're young and super fit I still recommend you start light there's a lot of benefit to using very heavy clubs but you have to do the right exercises there's certain exercises that you will do only with heavier clubs not only with heavier clubs there are certain exercises that you will avoid with super heavy clubs that can cause so much damage you have to get surgery and I don't want you to experience that so I want you to work your strength up with light gloves or you might already have been doing it for a while go heavy but if you're going to go heavy go heavy with a good coach so that you don't get injured but let me know in the comment section what are you working with now if you are you been thinking about it and if you are heavy what do you what exercises you do with the heavier clubs what exercises you do do you do my words are all rushing together with the lighter clubs put that in the comment section and then I will we're still going to work Tombo maybe later today I still have a video that I've been working on talking about my everyday carry and what that looks like three different concepts the mental training part what happens if you're in a non-permissive environment and then if you are in a permissive environment you can carry obviously you can carry your blade you can carry your self-defense tool what what do I carry cuz you've been asking me that anyway I'll see you guys in a little bit I'm headed to work",
