wrestlers.\n\nIndian clubs were used in Europe and USA for remedial gymnastics in the 18th and 19th century, by pioneers of physiotherapy.\n\nforeign [Music] Circle so we're going to bring the clubs up above our head and we're going to cross the midline straight away and return to the top position now when I reach there I want to alternate my Crossing hands just like we did with the pendulums yeah so work on one rep at a time and when that feels good then you can start having a bit more slow yeah so any type of movement where we cross the midline is defined as a closing movement or an inner type of circle when we're doing the Outer Circle we're going to let our arms fall out to the side and return to the start position so from here I'm just gonna keep the clubs in Pro against my arm cross at the bottom and return to the start just like we did before every time my hands are crossing and changing the leading hand of the top hand if you want again do a few reps of those nice and slow one rep at a time and then when comfortable you flow smoothly from one swing to the next no sudden acceleration strive to maintain a steady reliable casual tempo so if we have a parallel to One Direction of course we have the opposite as well so we've got parallel to the left parallel to the right so here I start at the top again to make it easy during the learning process and I'm going to slightly turn so the clubs are going to be really tight and closed against my body just like if there was a wall in front of me and they're both moving at the same speed so I turn slightly I start to drop I turn and I square up my body as I finish and again when you start feeling the flow of the move then you link the terms again no sudden acceleration keep it nice and smooth and flowy yeah boom now if you have troubles and you feel your arms are about to cross so you don't know exactly what's happening what you can do is just hold on to one club like this so you're going to start here everything is squared up turn to the one side bring the clubs in front of you and lift them up and return to the start yeah so we drop Square lift and then of course practice in both directions so every time that my arms are up or down yeah my body is squared up so there's no Crossing no tangling of the arms after view practice the circles in front of the body we're going to start practicing the circles by the side of the body now it's impossible to move both arms in the same direction at the same time without dislocating the shoulders so here we're going to work on a bit more complex movement we're going to add an element of a rhythm so the first is going to be alternating forward circles yeah so it's like doing the front crawl in the pool boom I can use my leg drive again boom I'm done finish [Music] return to order and then we're going to practice the reverse so I'm going to show different you this time but it's still the same principle one Club starts moving backwards it reaches the bottom position the next one starts yes I'm doing my back crawl [Music] next up we've got the opposite circles so one club is going to move forward and the other one is going to move backwards and this is really emphasizing the rotation through the upper body it's the only way you can do this properly without hurting your shoulders so let's have a look at it in slo-mo boom my body is squared up one Club Falls forward the other one backwards I look at the back Club here I am in the T sort of like both clubs are in line I square up again as my clubs are by the side of the leg I turn to the other side look at my back Club and then I come back and score out my body when they're both overhead so with a bit of speed and you guessed it two directions so now we're going to switch the right hand is going to move forward left is going to go back now what's important when I'm doing those circles by the side of the body is make sure that I stay in the right plane of motion right pain so you go to picture yourself inside a very narrow Corridor where you're basically scraping the walls yeah so there's a difference when I'm doing my back Circle going out wide I'm describing a small circle compared to here really tight against the legs and I'm describing the biggest circle that I can so this is what I want to achieve on every rep the biggest circle around the using the joint that we're supposed to to use so shoulder elbow or wrist doesn't matter same principle applies [Music] okay the next big circles we're going to look at are actually going to take place on the diagonal line so we're going to cross the midline and perform figure eights so it's going to be a tall figure eight instead of a flat cigarette let's look at it order you're going to Simply cross to the one side look at the club you come to the top there and you're going to swing both arms to the other side so we've got a side to side swing nice tight close against my legs so I want to stand with my feet right under my hips so I'm not swinging out wide or hitting my knees yeah let's take a look at the side view so here boom I start and moving forward my Knuckles are driving the movement imagine you're chopping somebody in two halves yeah so the edge of your sword has to be pointing downwards boom [Music] so for the reverse eight we're going to bring one club to order turn and look over that shoulder let both clubs describe a circle by the side of the body and then switch across there's a bit of side bending element in this exercise we are coiling the core harnessing all the power from our midsection to drive the clubs notice I'm still pivoting with my feet as well yeah side view look back boom so this time the knuckles are facing up to the ceiling as we drive the sword from the ground up to the ceiling boom so here's a quick little combination that you can do where you're going to introduce again the element of stepping and turning 90 degrees so just like we did with the pendulums where we start with the Crossing in front of the body and turning to the side into the opposite pendulum we're going to repeat the same sequence but this time we're going to do full circles so we're going to start with the inner and you could also try it with the outer circles and then we're going to turn and it's going to change into the opposite circles where we're going to end up swinging by the side of the body so let's take a look and practice a few times all right so from order I bring the clubs up I start with my first Circle second third and the fourth and without stopping I got one two three and four come back to the center one two three and four to the other side one two three and four back to Center one two three four out of the circle one two three four and turn one two three four back to Center one two three four turn one two three four and back to the center where we close okay so there's a bit of work there for you guys and girls mastering the timing when is it exactly that I have to turn so that do not interrupt the smoothness of the swings and therefore the flow [Music] so now we're going to look at the elbow circles elbow circles are involved when we're doing the heart-shaped swings so this is going to basic and short introduction that will help you build the foundations to learn and progress to the different type of r-shaped swings so the first one we're going to do is from the order position do a front elbow Circle so the clubs is going to swing from order and return to order and you can see when I catch that order I'm not centered but I'm slightly out to the side this allows me to launch the next Club boom yeah so just let the arm stretch out and return to order so every time side to side and following the club with my eyes and my head I stay nice and relaxed use the breathing to to help the timing as well so very simple the alternating low cast or alternating Front Circle again one name is what it's called in a system and then in another system they call it something different but basically it's a circle based around our elbow right now if you can go in and cross the midline at the start you can also do the opposite where you're going to turn this time look at the club situated to your back so this one is front this one's at the back and now let's swing boom from out to in and there we go so now we're doing the outer alternated circles right of course you can experiment also with the parallel variations [Music] but the next one we need to focus on is the um back circles and when we mentioned back Circles of course it's a circle happening behind the back but it's a high Circle otherwise it would be called Low back Circle right so from the older position we're going to bring the club up as if we're blocking a Blow To The Head the end of the club is going to point directly at the opposite shoulder and now you can see my elbow is about 90 degrees bent I'm going to close that Gap so the club slides and falls at the same time or drops and as soon as it goes over my shoulder I pull it back down into the odor yeah so here boom nice and slow control now the movement is happening around the elbow the only thing your wrist is doing is a slight deviation like this yeah we're not trying to use the wrist to do this swing now what is important is to relax so you can do that by relaxing your grip you see that basically my little finger is choking onto the knob here and providing enough grip that don't have to squeeze the rest of my hand so yes I'm still holding the club with all the digits but it's a very nice and loose grip as soon as the club is in motion swinging behind my back look at the end of the club over the opposite shoulder bend the elbow and pull down to order so we have basically a push a relax a Twist and Turn and pull yeah you see my body is not centered I'm facing a little bit to the side I push twist and pull push twist and Pull and the trick is finding the Rhythm the timing when I'm supposed to do the different actions the more I can relax the smoother my swing will be if you still have problems feeling the swing behind your back you can experiment with a slightly heavier club or you can use the physics and the gravity to your advantage so from the old position we're going to press the club directly up into What's called the torch position yeah boom from here I'm going to Simply maintain my elbow pointing up and bend it so the club's going to fall behind me and pull now that extra drop accentuate the forces and might help you to understand the swing a little bit better yeah next up is the last of the three pivot Points we're going to look at wrist circles this can be a little bit challenging so we're going to introduce a a prop to help you learn the swing a lot faster so let's look at the wrist circles from the older position boom and then you can start adding or linking the swings but remember when you're learning a new movement the best is just do one repetition Mark a short break and then link the next one okay so these are forward circles from the old position and then of course we have the reverse Boom the club starts Falling Towards my shoulder and return to order so once you know the forward and backwards you probably guessed it you can also do opposite wrist circles okay so these are the possibilities that you have in this plane of motion once you've learned and we're going to go to the tutorial and the enhanced tutorial so you're going to learn it faster once you learn the those three circles you also want to practice them from the flag position with the arms out to the side so you can have the away from the body outer circles towards the body inner circles okay so it's a good idea to be able to do those circles in any type of position because then you can start adding them at different uh section of your swings so combining the wrist circles with the larger Circle and so on and we'll look at a few examples after the tutorial okay guys using a wall is the fastest way to learn the wrist circles gives you instant feedback and adjusts the trajectory of your swing so what you do is you step close to the wall should be roughly like a hence width apart between your shoulder and the wall you come to your order position let the club rest against the wall yeah from there the club's going to drop forward your pound is gonna face up to the ceiling and you can release the three digits the last three digits so you're holding on to the club with the ring grip okay now the club is pointing down this time you can see my elbow has moved in towards my Center Line yeah the Palm is facing fully up the club has not dropped in my hand I'm still holding on to the same position as I had a full grip so avoid letting the club drop so you're only uh only holding on to the knob yeah so here I am and from here I'm going to use the acceleration to bring the club back to order and observe now the position of my hand low launch it's climbing it's coming up and as I pull down to order it drops so try um thinking it's like a full body exercise that just holding the wrist in place and trying to those circles especially important if using heavier clubs then of course we've got the reverse boom as always when you're learning one rep at a Time Boom Mark the order and then you can start linking remember don't let go of that ring grip so once you've worked with the circles and you start to develop some kind of feeling for the pool of gravity and the flow timing and so on you can experiment and try to add wrist circles to other type of circles so remember that the direction of both circles have to match so for example if I'm doing an inner inner shoulder Circle yeah if I had a wrist circle of course has to be a wrist Circle towards the body as well so I can just carry on from the one into the next and the same is true here going out this way or yeah so it's going to be a work of self-discovery I hope you enjoy adding the little new dimension of wrist circles to you of the circles",
