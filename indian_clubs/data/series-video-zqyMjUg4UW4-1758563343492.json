from eric sport welcome to the channel so today we're going to take a look at wrist circles with indian clubs for hema some people hate the indian clubs for hammer some people love them i think we just need to separate you know the ancient tradition of what they were designed for in the first place training warriors wrestlers and so on so martial arts application and the more modern more recent visual performance application of indian clubs so let's be on the same page most people would associate indian clubs with this type of clubs okay either bottle shape or teardrop shape that were introduced by the british in europe around the 1800s and basically those clubs i'm back they can weigh anything from half a kilo to two kilos now two kilos in india for an indian club or mod gar or mock doll or whatever variation of the name you can think of would be a very light club the warriors and the wrestlers train with large bulky and heavy clubs or maces for the most okay so this club here for example is a 5.5 kilo club and to top it up it's got a really thick grip so i'm not just going to twirl it and make the okay sign because that's definitely not going to be okay it's going on the floor so you can see what's happening here i'm holding my full grip and this is basically the type of grip i would recommend if you are into hema however most adults are lacking the mobility around the wrist to be able to perform smooth wrist circles so the recommended option what i choose for when i'm teaching people is to learn the ring grip so start with that so you can get a feel for the wrist circles so it doesn't look clunky and always start with one you know and then you can start of linking them okay so this is fine yeah and then eventually you want to start like keeping the full grip without you know the white knuckle death grip on the on the club otherwise you're gonna tense up the whole arm and you can't really move that club okay so the ring grip is a fine way to get started to learn the movement and you know you can make those circles in both directions of course but then you want to sort of like graduate to being able to do them with a full grip so with the large heavy clubs most of the moves are based on attacks and by attacks i mean by moves where you cross the midline because that's our strongest uh movement pattern yeah so going away from the midline would be like akin to throwing a dart whereas you know crossing the midline you know you're sword fighting okay boom throwing a spare uh throwing an axe wrestling arm wrestling you know the winner is the guy that crosses the midline this is where we're strong and you lose by going away from the midline so the light clubs open different type of patterns you can do them you know very fancy linking all this kind of stuff but we went from you know the purpose of the indian club that was to train fighters and wrestlers to more of a spectator sport visual performance and this is where the clubs got lighter so you can do new patterns by changing grips you know doing the snakes and all this kind of stuff and it's very available for dexterity and stuff you know but if you're training for a hammer the full grip is the way to go doing the wrist circles with the full grip require more awareness mobility and coordination than using the ring grip okay so you have to practice and when you practice you don't want a stupidly heavy club okay now this club here is our palavendor gamma it's got a 40mm handle so it's still a very thick handle you can see like i'm just closing it here and this is what the forward wrist circle looks like now when we say wrist circle it's actually the club doing a circle because our wrist if you observe now is doing a type of rolling motion okay and the same when i go in reverse so when you practice you know you gotta figure out you gotta imagine you got a wall next to you so the club stays as perpendicular to the ground as possible while your elbow comes in towards the midline as the club drop okay so pay attention to the hand position how much it goes up and down and the displacement towards the midline from my elbow yeah and then you can sort of like do fun stuff and i'm hauling the full grip okay so the full grip we've got two variations you could say you've got the hammer grip yeah perpendicular and this would be used as a resting position or transition position and then you've got the saber grip where the handle of the club is in the proponention of your forearm and kind of like all those moves around there using the saber grip okay so for hema they're the two main groups you need to master worry about and just have a firm grip but relaxed enough to be able to transition between those movements okay also important that you will build some strength by doing wrist circles which also do some direct work to strengthen your wrist and your fingers and your hands in general and again i'll put a link in the description to a circuit where you just follow along to a couple of times a week works great also if you're training for hematite don't just you know be lame and go around replicating sword moves with your heavy weighted club okay it's not a full product it's not full body program for hema so you need to do something more than just swing and twirl the clubs around okay thanks for watching remember to subscribe hit the
