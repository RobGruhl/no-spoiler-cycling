      "transcriptText": "\"A Practical Guide To Squad And Setting-Up Drill\" is drill instruction manual that was written by Bertram Browne,  in 1871.\n\nIt was designed for newly recruited soldiers, with exercises designed to improve strength and mobility of the upper limbs, posture and of course, teach discipline.\n\nAfter the introduction, Thierry demonstrates the military Indian clubs exercises from the book, as he understood them.\n\n➡ How and why the Brits adopted the Indian clubs\n\n➡ The different designs of Indian clubs\n\n➡ Indian club swinging vs British club swinging\n\n➡ Military stance and the lack of it in some of the old books\n\nLooking at club swinging in that way, he also raises some questions. If you have answers, we'd love you to join in the discussion in the comments!\n\nConor Heffernan has published academic research about Indian clubs, and is currently working an assistant Professor in Physical Culture and Sport Studies (Department of Kinesiology and Health Education) at the University of Texas.\n\nIndian clubs used in this video\n\nStep by step tutorials & programs\n\nWhat can Indian clubs do for you?\n\nGently mobilizes the shoulders, elbows and wrists and improve range of motion\n\nStrengthens the shoulder girdle and grip ( muscles and connective tissues) in its full range of motion\n\nConsists of compound movements in multiple planes\n\nProvides low impact cardiovascular exercise\n\nAssists recovery from intense training\n\nImproves the 3 pillars of physical literacy (body control , locomotion and object control)\n\nIt is fun and you forget you are training.\n\nThe rhythmic and repetitive patterns are highly meditative and calm the nervous system, like meditation.\n\nCross crawl exercises and other challenging moves improve learning capacity and stimulate neurogenesis, the creation of new brain cells.\n\n❂ Heroic Sport| An ancient discipline\n\nOur clubs are easily adjustable, which is a modern twist on the ancient traditional Indian clubs used to train Tamil and Persian warriors and wrestlers.\n\nIndian clubs were used in Europe and USA for remedial gymnastics in the 18th and 19th century, by pioneers of physiotherapy.\n\n❂ Ready to learn more?\n\nAll our educational material has been tested and structured since 2010, in a way that is easy for anyone to learn from home.\n\nBest regards from Thierry & Ron\n\nhey it's terra firma export so a while back we posted a video about the Mitra stance and how we didn't think it was relevant to training with Indian clubs for Hema now there are historical European martial arts often fight with two-handed weapons or with the shield in our opinion the military stance where you stand with your heels together and the turret on the out to the side and where the clubs move around the body for the first it was designed for very light Indian clubs you won't be able to do that with heavy ones and yeah it's just it's a good way to isolate and put more emphasis around the shoulder joint but it's not way a good way to integrate the whole body as you would need when fighting with heavy weapons anyway one of the person left a comment a very interesting comment and in the end I sort of agreed that the Mitra stance wouldn't be the best way to practice you know if you are using it for enhancing your skills but and there is a but it is very important to develop the proper posture according to certain old manuals and this one didn't know it's a book by Bertram Brown I'll put a link in the description so you can also check it out now there are six exercise that they do with Indian clubs there and they're kind of like linked to a whole system that they were using to develop the proper posture and also to assist in the marching and all this kind of stuff so Jim might be coming to visit us here in Denmark and I hope yes the the time to do that in in some weeks that'd be really awesome to have him here and talk back and forth on the different ideas now Jim didn't think that the exercise were the same ones as were popular during the Victorian era where club swinging was a big hit you know it's very different from the other exercise that you'll find in most of the old books you know from 1862 well the one of the latest one I think is war man 1915 so I'm gonna demonstrate the exercise my interpretation of them and I don't find them all that different although there are some twists because they yeah well they are more like sort of towards building strength and then I'll I'll make some comments about the historical background context some parallels some differences with the training winning in clubs in India at the time where the the British pick up the idea to implement in the military heels are together fit that 45 degrees knees a lot and straight the upper body is slightly leaning forward and you know straight square up with shoulders and the hips and you have to maintain that position the first exercise described is sort of like well we call it the shoulder this woman right it was done with a longer stick but basically holding a snatch grip you're gonna bring the stick behind while maintaining that square opposition now in all the exercises where the clubs or the implements are brought behind the body they struck just leaning into forward so that you feel the weight on the ball of your feet and not a slight forward movement happening as you're raising the arms behind the body ideally you could like you know slide a piece of paper under here under the heels without any problems so shoulder dislocates recommending 12 repetitions the section on Indian clubs as six exercises now the clubs are rather long and this is like close enough to what I could find that we have here at or export to replicate the exercises those clubs measure 65 centimetres in the book the length is 2 feet or 61 centimeter now we must have been swimming with the height of the soldiers as well because they can in the at-ease position they could actually lean and have the hands resting on the clubs and I can't okay so this is this will be the at each position and the attention position is then like this with the palms of the hands of the wrists facing slightly forward from there they would go on to take a check for distance in safety exercise number one so goes like this one hand is going to come out to the side come out to this position here with the figures in the elongated position and then come to the other hand as well here lowering both arms to shoulder level and then returning to the attention exercise number two is both arm at once doing the exercise for number one so like this guessing again this is my interpretation of how the exercise done according to the book it'd be interesting to see what our friend Jim good has in mind in the way he thinks of the exercises exercise number three starting from this position here with the clubs and the hands touching roughly together bring him out to the side then the clubs are gonna rotate backwards palms facing up you lower down and then you could add an extra little step where you return to that position the first trip the fourth exercise starts in the carry o'clock position which is what we refer as the old position from here you thread the arm right through and return to order whoops remember everything has to be squared up forward exercise number five is a simple pendulum going back and forth by the side of the body again going onto the toes as the club move behind the body the sixth exercise raising the club above the shoulder and then behind the back in alternating the arms again I find this very challenging because the guidelines are to keep the shoulders the hips and shoulders squared up so why did the Brits take up club swinging in indigenous training practice of course they admired the physics of the people swinging the clubs but there was also health reasons the Brits stationed in India working for the East India Company were not in very good health so the the doctors start to prescribe Indian clubs as part of medicine you know just like some doctors are doing today they sort of like a style you know talking about using some of the principles of Avera or traditional indian medicine but it was still you know acknowledged that Western medicine was superior but the club swing was kind of an exception to the rule so Club swinging was good so as the Brits start to adopt the club swimming they sort of transformed it into remodel into something use they could call it their own and this is where we have the appearance of this different shape club's smaller and lighter now the regulation Army Club back in the 1850s was 2 kilos yeah so about four pounds interestingly when men and women were competing in club swinging competitions they were also using two kilos now let's look a bit at the different clubs right so this would be a typical Indian club yeah this one is like a Calicut eye it's based on the calicut I also called Magda and the Paladin del excel is also one of those type of clubs and then we have something there would be close to the regulation army club that they used back in the day in the military this would be the club that we use that would be recommended for men starting club swinging in the civilian department and then you will also go to down to those smaller clubs called the teardrop clubs so this is like about 700 grams this is 1.2 2.4 then we've got one here weighing five and a half and the excel just like name displays is actually an adjustable Club you can fill up to 20 kilo which would not be you know what I'm coming back in let's say now this is not a knitting club it looks the same yeah same kind of design teardrop but this weighs about 300 grams and it's used in rhythmic gymnastics now it's fine you can twirl you can do great to do many fancy complex patterns but it's not the same purpose as Indian clubs you know so great for kids to get started whatever but I would not so a lot of the old books including those published by former military into a lot of exercise for the city and club swinging if we look again at the six exercise that I covered at Beeman of video the exercise by Darren brown they're very simple they're mostly based on our tool going circles or backward going circles and they are done actually with the heavier weights than what you find you recommended five seven and nine pounds most of the other authors recommended that one kilo as the starting point for men and about seven of the grams starting point for women anything under that was just for children the club that I used to demonstrate the exercise sixty-five cents a minute and two point four kilos so roughly what Graham have recommended as the starting weight for the military exercises so obviously as you've seen the exercise I kind of like drawn out trying to build up some some strength around the shoulder more than concentrating on fancy exercises even the way they doing the circles behind the back is not what we we know or where we would think of should be done you know the heart shape swing they were just doing a very basic circle with the arm extended interestingly with the fingers pointing out palms up so yeah it is different from the exercise that we've done but the public around at the same time but really you can find the similarities again I said a lot of outer circles and we have one exercise that we use you know in the career for the four count swing or the alternating back circles basically that's what it is this one is based on an inner circle which is your dominant you're your strong side of the circle that's the one you used to hammer something javelin to chop and enemy down with a sword now interestingly the the Brits were also station all the way them to Madras which is now chennai tamilnadu so they would have encountered the calicut i down there and Calicut i'll as 64 swings only four of those are done with double clubs yet most of the systems english systems that you'll find about Indian clubs are done with two clubs in Calicut I again a lot of cross cutting exercise because everything is based on the sword attack or closed that's a generalization anyway but baseball martial arts purpose so they taking the outer swing is almost non-existent also they do most of the exercise with the single club again only four are done with double clops many of an exercise are done with two hands on the club or this switch grip or single hand where they're going to switch hands from rep to rep so they'll just on one Sun and switch the hand so there's a lot of dexterity and the coordination of back gripping and regrouping and is involved in those exercise so if I need to be interesting that non or almost nobody that came up with books and training systems except for Worman we published a book in 1915 he recommended to start training with a single Club and this also what we do here at our export it makes a lot more sense coordinate the movement single arm there's less going on so you can learn it faster learning better and there's just matter of putting the two together and we find that teaching new beginners this kind of progression works better of course when you're working as well the same club you sort of like you can start with a heavier Club for example in the calicut I tradition they start basically with the club that's around four kilos for somebody who weigh 70 kilos so it's about a sixteenth of your own body weight is recommended as the starting clock in other part of images clubs I call markdowns and again they also used as single sometimes for two hands on the handle as well or they use as double and mostly the the XS that you'll see are basically like done in the Persians Oconee they are the back circles alternating back so that's pretty much all they do with it if we look at the juries the really long Club used by the wrestlers they are such a specialized club with a you know that length and the big pummel that you cannot use them for much else than doing back circle so the purpose there is actually to learn how to throw an opponent over your shoulder yeah the shorter clubs and larger clubs allow you to do a lot more fancy figures relying a lot more on wrist circle as well to you know to add some elegance to to the swings based a lot on the outter going circles so it's a different system and I've heard from people who've been to India that doing the outer circles or absolute shape swings doesn't come easily to the engines we've been training with a heavy clubs and concentrating in Pakistan they have what's called the monkey clock which is basically a huge version of our excel and we just swung with two hands behind the back and the goal here is just to do the heaviest swing that you can so it's more like a weightlifting competition than swinging for repetitions so it would be interesting to know if those six exercise that Brown picked were the ultimate exercise or if indeed there were other exercise included in the training region of the British military I've seen some old footage where they do a lot of the heavens six type of moon tour the figure Eight's movements as well windmills and all this kind of stuff so there must have been more how important or how traditional military exercise they wear I do not know it was it something that you know the soldiers played with watching some of the engines and you also have to remember that the Indian military was swinging in different ways than the engine wrestlers and yeah the Brits were again swinging totally different started from those two populations so very broad you know it's really hard to tell what is right traditional and correct so observe that in the Indian club swing community a lot of people advocate oh you should always be swinging in the me tree stance you should always swing with two clubs the club should only be very light clubs all this kind of like document that comes in which doesn't really help anything there are many different type of Club swinging traditions out there people swinging Club bells of the steel clubs they actually inspired of some exercise so you know there's nothing wrong about combining elements as well it's also what we do export involving the clubs with our body movements body exercises good personally we recommend the Mitra stance when you're trying to really focus on mobilizing the show because the effect is going to be concentrated there you want to keep the body squared up and then the club is moving around buddy but it's different way of training you got less stability so it of course it's designed for smooth and light clubs if you're going to be swinging heavy clubs you need more stability so as soon as you spray the base of support you can you can swing more weight you can also involve the whole body into the swing so it's not just moving from around the shoulder it becomes a true full body exercise so final thing the training recommendations for the club swing exercise and actually any of the exercise mentioned in Brown's book the drills should be done in short focused periods and repeated often that's the best way we learn and we know that that's the way the best for example music musicians piano players the best athletes they just reuse well while fresh and they dimension to to spay to pay special attention to not overly tiring or training to fatigue it was also for actually for the instructors sake so various sound and efficient training recommendations there and we actually find the parallel with the traditional Indian medicine that mentioned that you should actually train until you get a light sweat on your forehead and then that's it so yeah short frequent not too fatigued yeah so if you if you follow pebbles recommendation your this will ring a bell so if you got any information I've been reading some of the old books especially about the military side of club swinging get in touch with us leave a comment below paulo vandal from heroic sport exercise

kilos yeah so about four pounds interestingly when men and women were competing in club swinging competitions they were also using two kilos now let's look a bit at the different clubs right so this would be a typical Indian club yeah this one is like a Calicut eye it's based on the calicut I also called Magda and the Paladin del excel is also one of those type of clubs and then we have something there would be close to the regulation army club that they used back in the day in the military this would be the club that we use that would be recommended for men starting club swinging in the civilian department and then you will also go to down to those smaller clubs called the teardrop clubs so this is like about 700 grams this is 1.2 2.4 then we've got one here weighing five and a half and the excel just like name displays is actually an adjustable Club you can fill up to 20 kilo which would not be you know what I'm coming back in let's say now this is not a knitting club it looks the same yeah same kind of design teardrop but this weighs about 300 grams and it's used in rhythmic gymnastics now it's fine you can twirl you can do great to do many fancy complex patterns but it's not the same purpose as Indian clubs you know so great for kids to get started whatever but I would not so a lot of the old books including those published by former military into a lot of exercise for the city and club swinging if we look again at the six exercise that I covered at Beeman of video the exercise by Darren brown they're very simple they're mostly based on our tool going circles or backward going circles and they are done actually with the heavier weights than what you find you recommended five seven and nine pounds most of the other authors recommended that one kilo as the starting point for men and about seven of the grams starting point for women anything under that was just for children the club that I used to demonstrate the exercise sixty-five cents a minute and

some strength around the shoulder more than concentrating on fancy exercises even the way they doing the circles behind the back is not what we we know or where we would think of should be done you know the heart shape swing they were just doing a very basic circle with the arm extended interestingly with the fingers pointing out palms up so yeah it is different from the exercise that we've done but the public around at the same time but really you can find the similarities again I said a lot of outer circles and we have one exercise that we use you know in the career for the four count swing or the alternating back circles basically that's what it is this one is based on an inner circle which is your dominant you're your strong side of the circle that's the one you used to hammer something javelin to chop and enemy down with a sword now interestingly the the Brits were also station all the way them to Madras which is now chennai tamilnadu so they would have encountered the calicut i down there and Calicut i'll as 64 swings only four of those are done with double clubs yet most of the systems english systems that you'll find about Indian clubs are done with two clubs in Calicut I again a lot of cross cutting exercise because everything is based on the sword attack or closed that's a generalization anyway but baseball martial arts purpose so they taking the outer swing is almost non-existent also they do most of the exercise with the single club again only four are done with double clops many of an exercise are done with two hands on the club or this switch grip or single hand where they're going to switch hands from rep to rep so they'll just on one Sun and switch the hand so there's a lot of dexterity and the coordination of back gripping and regrouping and is involved in those exercise so if I need to be interesting that non or almost nobody that came up with books and training systems except for Worman we published a book in 1915 he recommended to start training with a single Club and this also what we do here at our export it makes a lot more sense coordinate the movement single arm there's less going on so you can learn it faster learning better and there's just matter of putting the two together and we find that teaching new beginners this kind of progression works better of course when you're working as well the same club you sort of like you can start with a heavier Club for example in the calicut I tradition they start basically with the club that's around four kilos for somebody who weigh 70 kilos so it's about a sixteenth of your own body weight is recommended as the starting clock in other part of images clubs I call markdowns and again they also used as single sometimes for two hands on the handle as well or they use as double and mostly the the XS that you'll see are basically like done in the Persians Oconee they are the back circles alternating back so that's pretty much all they do with it if we look at the juries the really long Club used by the wrestlers they are such a specialized club with a you know that length and the big pummel that you cannot use them for much else than doing back circle so the purpose there is actually to learn how to throw an opponent over your shoulder yeah the shorter clubs and larger clubs allow you to do a lot more fancy figures relying a lot more on wrist circle as well to you know to add some elegance to to the swings based a lot on the outter going circles so it's a different system and I've heard from people who've been to India that doing the outer circles or absolute shape swings doesn't come easily to the engines we've been training with a heavy clubs and concentrating in Pakistan they have what's called the monkey clock which is basically a huge version of our excel and we just swung with two hands behind the back and the goal here is just to do the heaviest swing that you can so it's more like a weightlifting competition than swinging for repetitions so it would be interesting to know if those six exercise that Brown picked were the ultimate exercise or if indeed there were other exercise included in the training region of the British military I've seen some old footage where they do a lot of the heavens six type of moon tour the figure Eight's movements as well windmills and all this kind of stuff so there must have been more how important or how traditional military exercise they wear I do not know it was it something that you know the soldiers played with watching some of the engines and you also have to remember that the Indian military was swinging in different ways than the engine wrestlers and yeah the Brits were again swinging totally different started from those two populations so very broad you know it's really hard to tell what is right traditional and correct so observe that in the Indian club swing community a lot of people advocate oh you should always be swinging in the me tree stance you should always swing with two clubs the club should only be very light clubs all this kind of like document that comes in which doesn't really help anything there are many different type of Club swinging traditions out there people swinging Club bells of the steel clubs they actually inspired of some exercise so you know there's nothing wrong about combining elements as well it's also what we do export involving the clubs with our body movements body exercises good personally we recommend the Mitra stance when you're trying to really focus on mobilizing the show because the effect is going to be concentrated there you want to keep the body squared up and then the club is moving around buddy but it's different way of training you got less stability so it of course it's designed for smooth and light clubs if you're going to be swinging heavy clubs you need more stability so as soon as you spray the base of support you can you can swing more weight you can also involve the whole body into the swing so it's not just moving from around the shoulder it becomes a true full body exercise so final thing the training recommendations for the club swing exercise and actually any of the exercise mentioned in Brown's book the drills should be done in short focused periods and repeated often that's the best way we learn and we know that that's the way the best for example music musicians piano players the best athletes they just reuse well while fresh and they dimension to to spay to pay special attention to not overly tiring or training to fatigue it was also for actually for the instructors sake so various sound and efficient training recommendations there and we actually find the parallel with the traditional Indian medicine that mentioned that you should actually train until you get a light sweat on your forehead and then that's it so yeah short frequent not too fatigued yeah so if you if you follow pebbles recommendation your this will ring a bell so if you got any information I've been reading some of the old books especially about the military side of club swinging get in touch with us leave a comment below paulo vandal from heroic sport exercise wherever whenever reboot your mind and body\n\n\n## Endscreen\n    \n- [Where to look when swinging Indian clubs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZkpN5FJnF4)",

your Kel belt juggling so to make it easiest to catch the handle again when you make it flip you have to make sure that when you let go of the handle it's really in a neutral position so the handle is not at an angle the flip through the air gonna make it impossible to catch again so make sure that you release the kettlebell with the handle neutral parallel to the ground or perpendicular to the ground the next thing is that when you release the quelle Belle and make it flip you don't just want to make it describe a big movement right through the air through space you wanna make sure that that quelle Belle becomes weightless and spins on its own axis staying at the same height in the same distance from your body the swings are gonna use when you're juggling with Kelly bells it's quite different from a fitness swing or swing when you try to accelerate as much as possible here it's more kind of relaxed tempo and you're my swing in a different slightly different style that you usually do with the basic flips you have different progression options too to get family to throwing and catching again so it's going to be with two hands on the Cal bear then one hand then hand to hand and then eventually can also have one killer Belle in each hand the last thing when you're doing quelle Belle juggling and tricks it's also important to be uncomfortable with moving around and with the cowbell so it's good idea to practice may be walking swings in your warmup [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
