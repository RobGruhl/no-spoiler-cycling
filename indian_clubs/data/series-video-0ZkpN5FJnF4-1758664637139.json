tips that i share with you your swinging become a lot smoother and more fluid so let's get ready and get into it i want to make a case for new beginners to start incorporating more head movement more eye movement okay this stimulates your brain improves your balance and a lot of many other good things okay now if you're into the strict rigid military style club swinging where nothing moves and just the arms and the clubs that's fine okay just go and find another channel we don't teach that way we teach a more natural where the whole body is engaged when there is rotation happening right from your feet knees hips shoulders and head okay we stimulate the brain every time we rotate from side to side okay so if you've got balance problem that's the first step start moving your head as you're walking you're gonna find it kind of challenging okay the better you get at this everything becomes easier when it comes to balance and also when you're swinging clubs because you won't have to think about turning so much i mean once everything is coded in you know you can even close the eyes look straight ahead and you're going to move fluidly but you know from experience teaching new beginners this works so if i'm um swinging by the side of the body and i'm not doing much movement the clubs are moving parallel or in sync there's no need to look anywhere else i mean of course i can do it as an excise in itself yeah but what it becomes apparent is if the clubs move out of sync because now they're going each their way and instead of just being strict and rigid like that you just allow for the natural rotation of the spine so i'm going to look towards the back club on each rep okay a lot more stimulating for your brain than just looking straight ahead now if you're dealing with you know people that have some problems dizziness or whatever then you know it doesn't make sense so you sort of like get them to fix a point ahead for everybody else try this okay now if i'm using my hips you know boom again i want to keep the neck i want to you know everything lined up with my torso so i don't look like this and you can see my gaze is shifting okay i'm looking roughly two meters in front of me and then looking up so again eye movement head movement is happening here through the falling at the hips now when we're swinging in front of the body if it's a symmetrical pattern okay so be it this be it this there's no need for turning the head when we are doing asynchronic patterns turning the head and you can even overdrive it by you know offer and sizes look whatever word it is in english by looking over your shoulder okay so now i start the rotation through the spine here and i can assist the swing yeah boom so as in chronic clubs moving in the same direction like in a windmill or even a parallel heart-shaped swing okay boom parallel i look towards the club as i receive them against the body boom lift the elbow turn boom and facing the other direction okay so this turning of the head apart from stimulating your brain creating new pathways improving your balance it's also going to assist the often lacking rotation in the body that you need to perform a smooth swing okay so let us know in the comments if you find the tips helpful subscribe to the channel leave us a like catch in the next video [Music]\n\n\n## Endscreen\n    \n- [15
