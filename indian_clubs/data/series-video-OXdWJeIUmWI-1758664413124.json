from Thierry & Ron\n\nterry from hero export welcome to the channel in today's video we're going to be talking about light british style indian clubs i'm going to give you three main points before you get started on your club swimming journey and how to pick a set that is perfect for you we're going to cover shape and design starting weight and length let's get into it [Music] when it comes to british style engine clubs we've got basically two types of shapes or designs okay the first one is the classical teardrop with the long handle short body and all the weight is distributed towards the end of the club so it's basically like a very short mace okay and then you've got the bottle shape now these two here are modeled after what's called the new york style it's got a longer type of handle compared to this one here you can see which is called the boston style with a stubbier look shorter handle okay so the weight distribution with those two clubs even though they're the same weight is going to be affected and be different okay so for that club you can see the guess the the middle of the body we're talking about the center of gravity is gonna be around here and this one is gonna be probably a bit further down okay of course they slide longer um you know but you sort of like get a bottle shape or tear drop now those little clubs here designed for kids or rhythmic gymnastic based after the teardrop okay you've got a very narrow handle a round knob basically uh they're great for what you're supposed to use them but if you're looking after a training method with indian clubs you'll be better through something else you know leave this to the kids now the knobs you can see how very round and they're specifically used for doing all type of fancy uh figures and swinging with the knob which is not really considered a really proper grip when it comes to indian club swinging yes if you're very fancy perfect so you know be aware what you want you want to be doing fancy patterns or do you want to mobilize strengthen your shoulders okay this has to be taken into consideration so if now we'll take a look at the paleo vandal with the three quarter litre bottle with a long neck you can sort of see the similarities between the teardrop shape and the way those clubs are going to handle okay so same weight 750 700 grams pellet vandals or wooden clubs and here we have the same equivalent for the pellet vandal and the one liter bottle now if you put the insert they actually go up to 1.2 which is also the same weight as our medium-sized indian clubs as you can see you can fit different type of bottles and you can even change the filler by using sand and here you've got a club that weighs just about three kilos okay amazingly this little bottle of hoisin sauce filled up with the lead shot also weighs three kilos last detail about the design of the clubs is the handle itself now something that is very thin is not going to be so nice to handle so we like to settle on a nice solid reasonably grip handle and this is the same handle diameter that we have across the clubs we sell this is a prototype although we have versions like the gamma and the xl and the tg they have a thicker diameter handle but purely speaking about british style clubs this is what we found after all the years we've been turning clubs is the best for most people a lot of people recommend half killer clubs to get started with indian clubs now of course it's always better to be on the safe side and start with a lighter club than rather start with a heavier club but the old textbook let us know the proper guidelines for starting off with indian clubs one kilo to 1.2 kilo for men and up to 750 grams for ladies in competitions in the victorian era in the early 1900s the regulation weight was 2 kilo per club for ladies and men if you want a really large set of clubs because you're afraid of injuring yourself you want to test the waters whatever reason or maybe you only want to do complex swinging then you should join a rhythm gymnastic club you know if you go to a store then you'll be able to pick up a set of these clubs for about 15 euros but you won't be getting the same benefits as swinging a set of proper indian clubs last tip about picking a set of indian clubs that is right for beginners okay you don't want something that is too short or too long so what's too short well obviously this is too short okay tip of your fingertips to the crease of your elbow if it's shorter than that the club is too short you won't feel the momentum here boom slightly longer perfect length now what is too long knuckles center of the hand to your armpit maximum length to start off with swinging indian clubs this club would be too long okay and what happens is that because it's too long you're probably going to end up bashing the clubs behind your head especially and you will going and you're going to cut off the range of motion to sort of like avoid the club's bashing so instead of properly ever elevating your arms as you launch the club you're going to elevate out to the side do a lazy type of swinging it's not going to encourage good practice so keep those tips in mind when you're selecting a pair of indian clubs remember with the paler vandal it's pretty much foolproof you've got the right length you've got the adjustable weight and you know the design by changing the shape of the bottles as well so check it out if you haven't done so we've got starter kits on our webshop otherwise you can also take a look at our uniquely designed and handmade clubs here in denmark thanks for watching see you in another video [Music]",
