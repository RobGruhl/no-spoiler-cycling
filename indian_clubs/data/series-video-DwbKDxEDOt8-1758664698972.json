in this short video i'm going to tell you exactly what you need and how the whole course is going to unfold so first of all when people think indian clubs a lot of times they think about those short enlight clubs when the original indian club is more something like this so you can see a longer taller thicker heavier club and this is the adjustable version okay now for this course you know because it's instruction course you can use anything that you have just want to keep in mind that a very short clock like something like this that's also very light it's gonna make it really hard for you to actually feel the momentum in the pull of the swings and um you know it's not really recommended but of course you know you may do with what you have this is what you have now if you have a pala vandal right what i recommend you is to have a bottle filled up with water so a little bottle so you got a kilo a club weighing about a kilo and then try to see if you can have another bottle filled up with sand now if you're using sand a very good idea is to plug some kind of little silicone uh prop at the end so the sand doesn't tip out most importantly it doesn't get into the thread when you're screwing and screwing the handle okay so this is gonna work really well because this bottle here is about three kilos okay so at the end of the club you get a decent weight and leverage that's going to help you to actually feel the swings now some of the exercise we're going to do with two hands on the club like this so it's an advantage if you can screw the two parameters together you've got a longer club which is going to make it again easier for you to understand the mechanics of the swing cool so this is about what you need the other thing is of course a space where you can sort of like lift your arms above behind you without eating anything or anyone okay so just like a clotted free um area for training the daily sessions are about 15 minutes they include a warm-up you know most of the times and then we go straight into the exercises so it's gonna be a really nice and easy built up progressively so we go from very simple stuff to more complex stuff and by the end of day four you should be able to do the full swing which is called by some people the mill so we've got this swing in front of the body behind the body okay which is basically the signature move of indian clothes then on day five we put all the exercise together introduce some body weight exercise and we make it into a little short circuit training session for you to get a feel of how you can string all those exercises together to get an effective and fun training [Music]\n\n\n## Endscreen\n    \n- [Mugdar exercise workout (Mudgar /Clubbell) | Circular exercises with a
