  "transcriptText": "What can Indian clubs do for you?\n\nGently mobilizes the shoulders, elbows and wrists and improve range of motion\n\nStrengthens the shoulder girdle and grip ( muscles and connective tissues) in its full range of motion\n\nConsists of compound movements in multiple planes\n\nProvides low impact cardiovascular exercise\n\nAssists recovery from intense training\n\nImproves the 3 pillars of physical literacy (body control , locomotion and object control)\n\nIt is fun and you forget you are training.\n\nThe rhythmic and repetitive patterns are highly meditative and calm the nervous system, like meditation.\n\nCross crawl exercises and other challenging moves improve learning capacity and stimulate neurogenesis, the creation of new brain cells.\n\n❂ Heroic Sport | An ancient discipline\n\nOur clubs are easily adjustable, which is a modern twist on the ancient traditional Indian clubs used to train Tamil and Persian warriors and wrestlers.\n\nIndian clubs were used in Europe and USA for remedial gymnastics in the 18th and 19th century, by pioneers of physiotherapy.\n\nforeign so let's start with the basic swings and the pendulums so we're going to do a basic Pendulum by the side of the body when you swing by the side of the body I want to I want you to have your feet right under your hips so you're not going to hit your knees and the clubs are not going to fly out wide so the old position is here the clubs are vertical pointing to the ceiling from here you're simply going to let the clubs drop come into the prolongation of your arms and you're going to swing back and forth very simple so right now we're just swinging with the shoulders as the main Pivot Point now we're going to add a bit of hip movement so on the back swing I'm going to sit down and straighten up as the clubs come forward and return to order so the side view where conservative details when I sit back I bend at the knees and the hips while maintaining a Long Tall spine so from order the club swelling prongation of my arms that's the first thing and then I go straight into my swing foreign yes so practice that a little bit until you get the feel and remember at any times during this course you can pose take a break [Music] the second basic swing is based on the first one but this time the arms and the clubs are going to move in alternate fashion so one club is going to go forward while the other one is going back and I'm using a little bit of up and down movement known as leg drive to assist the swing now I'm going to turn and look towards my back Club on each rep I'm introducing an element of balance and engaging the whole vestibular system into this swing yeah so the side view from the auto position one Club starts and then here we are remember it's nice and gentle Tempo no rushing it it should feel rhythmic and smooth [Music] the next swing we're going to look at is called the swipe it's actually a prolongation of the pendulum where we have a definite end point to the swing we're going to catch the clubs over our shoulders on our back right so the first thing is the arm cast from the old position we're simply going to lift the elbows up so they point up to the ceiling and the clubs at the end of the club is pointing down towards the ground from here I'm going to engage my midsection so I've got a nice straight long spine pull the club back into order and so I just lift push pull push pull remember that you still want to have relaxed knees at the same time right so we're going to use the breathing as well so that's the arm cast now we're going to combine the swing by the side of the body and the arm cast to create the swipe so it looks like this from the other position push pull Club in the propagation of your arm back swing catch push pull and so on now the goal of the exercise is to make that transition between the two swings as smooth as possible so right now as you're learning we'll mark a little definite pose boom pose and so on and then the clubs are going to basically roll over your shoulders boom that was the swipe now like all the swings that we're going to show you you can always add some type of footwork combining the lower body and the upper body so here we're going to take our basic swipe and combine it with a front lunge so we start with the back swing as I come to the old position I'm going to step into that front lunge and catch the clubs in my bottom position of the lunge I pull as I stand up my feet come together on the same line I go into my back swing and then I switch yeah and when we have the flu so it becomes a more dynamic but still very rhythmic element yes [Music] we've been swinging by the side of the body this time we're going to do by the front of the body so we're going to start with a very basic pendulum again it's going to be a parallel pendulum so both arms are going to move in the same direction at the same speed this time when I'm swinging from side to side I'm gonna use a bit more floor space by standing wider so I've got stability from side to side no need to go bananas shoulder or round shoulder a little bit over it's all good so from the older position I'm going to set the clubs drop and swing to about shoulder height I'm still using that leg drive you can see my knees up and down moving the other thing you notice is that looking at the club's side to side so that's our basic pendulum in front of the body when I'm done I return to order [Music] another type of basic pendulum that will really help you when we are starting to play with circles and the heart-shaped swings is the crossing pendulum so this time from the old position we're going to cross the arms and the clubs let them swing out to shoulder height and return to order so you're basically learning how to cross and then cross without hitting the clubs now you can also do this exercise without coming to order so you just simply Crossing the arms remember to turn the thumbs up when they're clubs at Shoal level and wait until the last minute when they're almost brushing past the leg to turn clubs and have them cross right now a little detail is going to have you focus on which arm is Crossing so for example right now it's my right arm Crossing on top and then my left arm and then I go back to the right arm so every rep I alternate The Crossing hands so I've got balance in my training so already with the basic pendulums you can start combining swings and footwork to create interesting combinations and small flows so let's look at the first one just based on the crossing pendulum now we can decide to stop in this High position overhead or just to the flag position up to you yeah so the first stepping we're going to do is doing to do a basic front lunge and we're going to switch the legs on each repetition then we're going to look at the dragon lunge the dragon lunge you cross over and drop again to the depth that feels comfortable for you like this and then the last is going to be a simple step out to the side and sit back into a squat I'm going to step forward left and catch return to order boom right and catch now the dragon lunge a little tricky one oh the overhead squat watch that now wearing tight pants because they might split or they need to be reinforced at the stitching anyway play with this concept and you can see how putting simple movements become a lot more challenging that year involving your lower body this short combination is going to let you experience how small steps can actually dramatically change the shape of your swing and maybe also the timing so we're going to start with a Crossing pendulum in front of the body okay so both arms are moving in the same direction towards the midline and then we're going to step out 90 degrees and now the clubs are going to swing by the side of our body in alternate fashion so let's have a look we go here is our first Crossing one two three four I turn to the left one two three four come back to the center one two three four to the right one two three four back to the center one two three four and so on one two three four one two three four one two three four and we close yeah so just work on a nice relaxed floor you can see it's very rhythmic very soothing for your body and you start to create new neural adaptations just by involving that stepping coordinating um the lower body the upper body and the different type of swings that results of you turning [Music]",
