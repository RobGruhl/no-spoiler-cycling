  "transcriptText": "Originally filmed for Indian Clubs 1.5 and re-edited for Steel Mace Building Blocks, this is a beginner's instructional video for one of the most popular Indian Clubs moves out there- The Snake.\n\nall right y'all it is time for snakes I know a lot of people are very interested in this movement this is a cool one first thing we're going to have to talk about is the grip so there's a secret hidden grip when it comes to the snake I like to refer to it as a snake grip oh how I'm going to have my hand is like so thumb and fingers wrapped around index finger is cued over top of the head or of the palmel of the Indian club we can see this for a larger palmel or smaller hands two fingers might want to be involved the index and the uh middle finger this is of course totally doable this will work the snake is what I like to refer to as a work it's not quite as tricky as it looks it looks very fancy but in reality a single turn snake or even a double turn snake isn't too tricky of a movement it all comes down to this right here so if you can do this circle you can do a snake now what this circle is I start with the club hidden behind my arm I'm in that hook grip that snake grip the club is hidden behind my arm I do a circle to turn my hand around my palm is now facing forward the club is in tight this helps me go into my uh heart-shaped style elbow drive and then when I open up just like in a heart shape I let the club turn now in that single turn I'm letting it fall into this position so I'm holding it just with my index and my thumb essentially those other fingers are there for help but they don't really need to be the club isn't really moving it's opening into that position my hand turns around and pins it back it comes back down I'm in that start position turn the arm around open up like a heart shape flick turn Catch start to smooth it out flick turn catch let the club turn flick turn catch let the club turn flick turn catch let the club turn so we see that is just this circle here hard shape extension pinning the club back to the arm turn it around open it up catch it smooth strong control that's going to activate those wrists going to get those forearms firing of course it's going to be great for those shoulders as well get those down get that single Club down like I've talked about in other videos uh 10 minimum if you can do 10 Clean you can do it try and go for more though once you can do one try two so it's that same deal that double circle that flicking catch clubs come in they're hidden behind they turn around they open up turn and catch smooth controlled start to seam it up I like to extend either to a y or a t depending on what I'm trying to activate if I'm really trying to open up those shoulders of course it'll go to the Y but if I'm really f focus on just rocking the movement I'll go to the T mix it up now once you can do the double The Next Step would be to alternate it and again that just comes from putting in the time putting in the practice but the reverse snake Club starts forward now I'm going to rotate out to put the club behind my arm so we see that so in that forward snake I rotate towards my Center Line for the uh reverse snake the club starts in front of my arm it comes out hides behind my arm and lifts up it's that same style of hold that same flick turn catch and pin it comes in turns to hide flicks open so club's facing me I rotate out let the club turn let it turn flick it up let it turn flick it up so see how that club's pointed in my hand is up it turns around so the club can hide it's pinned against that form for the lift flick turn catch and smoothing it out flick turn catch flick turn catch flick turn catch the whole snake is right here that little circle to get the club around the arm arm is what makes it what it is once we can do one of course we take it to two once we can do two of course we try alternating good so on the movement know the movement on the movement conquer it earn it own it so those are the snakes again it all comes down to that turn sometimes you'll see people just turn the club around the arm that's an option another option is that nice Circle there play with them add to them see where we can take them you're going to get frustrated snakes can be tricky remember it's that turn that small turn is what really makes it happen that catch against the arm is very key if we can get that nice catch and we get a nice turn we're going to have a nice snake put the practice in get the Reps in it's the joy of repetition isue the more you get to do something the better you are at it what better excuse to do something more if you're not very good at it so if you're not very good at this do this Lots get good at it if you're already good at it fantastic do it lots get better at it Joy of repetition skills need to be practiced practice the skill add it to some other stuff build new things later on you're going to see a different pattern called The Clock Tower the clock tower is a pattern that I believe I came up with I don't know if I saw it somewhere in a d acted it but I'm pretty sure I came up with it you'll notice a lot of few a lot of things that are very similar to a snake and that's because I put a ton of time in with the snake so put a ton of time in figure out new patterns figure out your own patterns but watch for that clock tower practice those snakes and I'll see you in the next video",
