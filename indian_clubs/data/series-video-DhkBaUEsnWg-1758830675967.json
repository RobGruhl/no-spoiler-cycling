in better and more effective ways more even for athletics and we're going to do it best of all by using this setup which is a door frame so you don't need a one of those back extension 45 degree bench save money and also save space if you enjoy the content subscribe to our channel give us a like so we'll do more content right so let's check out the high tech gear that we're gonna be using piece of webbing two same length just couple of knots loops at the end okay now i'm using this setup at home where i've got one of those nice fancy swedish ladders i'm going at that not many people got them at home but the actual idea comes from coach summers gymnastic coach where they use those you know those ladders um so the the idea is just very simple we make a sling and we just use that to create our 45 degree bench okay now here's your door so make sure that they are the same length and the appropriate length for your door frame now i'm using the setup that i've got at home it's a little bit longer uh because my it's uh higher up but it's gonna work so yeah i just hook the straps on the other side i've got the luxury of having a lock so nobody's gonna open the door and i'm not gonna crash while i'm training up pulling the straps there you go so make sure to make a nice cup of coffee to your partner or you know put on a film or booby traps i mean they work as well so then you've got carabiners and i've got this uh this belt here rated to 2 000 kilos it's actually to pull uh trailers and and stuff like that you know but again be creative you know there are no excuses if you really want to do this and do it on the cheap you'll find a way if that's what you want to do so boom hook it in and the other one and then what you do is just very simple you walk away from the from the anchor point at the top you place it on your hip bone okay and you lean into it and you walk back okay so i'm gonna be stretching and putting uh loading on the left side of my body okay so my left leg is the one at the back so i can make sure that i've got pure lateral oh flexion okay now if you want to add load simple you know i've got kettlebells here i didn't think i was gonna grab 24 kilos right come on so i've got the uh you know the keyring version boom i can add you know whatever variation i want bring the elbow in all good i'm going to show you a view from the side here we go boom place on the hip bone walk your feet back make sure you've got the you know the top leg towards the back so you've got that perfect uh alignment and here we go yeah so as you can see the straps on this setup here a little bit too long for that door frame because they come from my home setup but basically you you get the idea how you can you know save money and save space great stuff now if you don't know what these are they are pillar vandals they are makeshift engine club you just grab those little handles and you put them onto a solar pop bottle and you've got an instant club if you don't know when clubs where they are well we've got lots of videos about that but in any case if you want to bulletproof your shoulders if you want to also work on your wrists and some with the whole type of leverage really cheap really easy way to get started you can adjust the weight you can adjust the leverage by putting more handles all together putting sand in the bottles okay cheap adjustable and you know got any questions check out our website drop us a note and we'll do our best to explain what indian clubs can do for your athleticism you",
