you can structure your training with a few basic exercise we're going to do a five minute circuit really no excuses right and if you've got more energy then of course you can repeat the circuit a couple of times and you could also consider changing the weight of the clubs each time you train the circuit now one thing to bear in mind when we're training with this open style of Club swinging and training with relatively light clubs the goal is on longevity and feeling good increasing your well-being and energy levels so one way to gauge if you're training has been correct for you is the way you feel after the training yeah if you feel better than you did before you start training then it's done its job that's it you don't need to do any more for today if by the country you feel a bit drained and tired or achy the following day as well then you've done too much that day so remember that and adjust the training correspondly so you'll be working on your Vitality your Mobility but you're building strength endurance at the same time just in a very slow but sustainable way okay so the circuit is 10 exercise each done for 30 seconds [Music] I've got my little timer here to set up and beat the first exercise is marching so we're going to start with the Feet Under right and we are already three two one and go boom so when you're ready you add the knee lift remember that we're working on opposite arm and leg to get the most of this brain training that we're doing at the same time if you want look at the back Club it's also okay to just look ahead find the stability remember no rushing I'm able to talk during this video because I've been training at a low level of intensity good next swing we're going to do a swipe followed by an overhead swing boom all the way up so swipe and then go all the way up really mobilizing the shoulders foreign whoops I did one more no problem and always adjust from here we're going to go behind the back so here boom engaging a chain of muscles we usually neglect behind the back really good to add those really good brain gymnastics at the same time getting that coordination Happening Here [Music] now I'm talking and Swinging doing too many things at once next order Crossing pendulum catch into an overhead lunge to the Y position and return to order [Music] we try to alternate The Crossing on the hands on each cycle remember to go to the depth that suits you that crawl so boom follow the club with the eyes try to keep the club in progression of your arm remember plenty of leg Drive side bending as well a little bit it's a little bit tough boom back to order Shield press back Circle Shield press back Circle yeah so we're really building the foundations for you to move better and become stronger and feel great oh order press to the flag and then swing into a squat and pull the bow swing back into place press in front of the body swing to the other side step pull the bow in that squat position [Music] so we try to time it catch into the bottom of our squat yeah small arm circles we reverse the grip arms out to the side smile yeah keep the knees nice and soft small circles five or so one way and then the other way and here we're adding an element of perturbation because the clubs are swinging and we have to provide extra stabilizations stabilization sorry while doing circles good grip now we're gonna do side to side swing but we're going to add a full circle in front of the body boom [Music] so it's a big big front Loop follow the club with the eyes use the leg Drive try to feel gravity pulling you yeah and last one is the reverse eight look at the club release the foot if needed to be able to twist side to side doing good guys and girls nearly done here you go try to stop my timer it's very enthusiastic that the circuit is over [Music]\n\n\n",

from eric sport welcome to the channel so today we're going to take a look at wrist circles with indian clubs for hema some people hate the indian clubs for hammer some people love them i think we just need to separate you know the ancient tradition of what they were designed for in the first place training warriors wrestlers and so on so martial arts application and the more modern more recent visual performance application of indian clubs so let's be on the same page most people would associate indian clubs with this type of clubs okay either bottle shape or teardrop shape that were introduced by the british in europe around the 1800s and basically those clubs i'm back they can weigh anything from half a kilo to two kilos now two kilos in india for an indian club or mod gar or mock doll or whatever variation of the name you can think of would be a very light club the warriors and the wrestlers train with large bulky and heavy clubs or maces for the most okay so this club here for example is a 5.5 kilo club and to top it up it's got a really thick grip so i'm not just going to twirl it and make the okay sign because that's definitely not going to be okay it's going on the floor so you can see what's happening here i'm holding my full grip and this is basically the type of grip i would recommend if you are into hema however most adults are lacking the mobility around the wrist to be able to perform smooth wrist circles so the recommended option what i choose for when i'm teaching people is to learn the ring grip so start with that so you can get a feel for the wrist circles so it doesn't look clunky and always start with one you know and then you can start of linking them okay so this is fine yeah and then eventually you want to start like keeping the full grip without you know the white knuckle death grip on the on the club otherwise you're gonna tense up the whole arm and you can't really move that club okay so the ring grip is a fine way to get started to learn the movement and you know you can make those circles in both directions of course but then you want to sort of like graduate to being able to do them with a full grip so with the large heavy clubs most of the moves are based on attacks and by attacks i mean by moves where you cross the midline because that's our strongest uh movement pattern yeah so going away from the midline would be like akin to throwing a dart whereas you know crossing the midline you know you're sword fighting okay boom throwing a spare uh throwing an axe wrestling arm wrestling you know the winner is the guy that crosses the midline this is where we're strong and you lose by going away from the midline so the light clubs open different type of patterns you can do them you know very fancy linking all this kind of stuff but we went from you know the purpose of the indian club that was to train fighters and wrestlers to more of a spectator sport visual performance and this is where the clubs got lighter so you can do new patterns by changing grips you know doing the snakes and all this kind of stuff and it's very available for dexterity and stuff you know but if you're training for a hammer the full grip is the way to go doing the wrist circles with the full grip require more awareness mobility and coordination than using the ring grip okay so you have to practice and when you practice you don't want a stupidly heavy club okay now this club here is our palavendor gamma it's got a 40mm handle so it's still a very thick handle you can see like i'm just closing it here and this is what the forward wrist circle looks like now when we say wrist circle it's actually the club doing a circle because our wrist if you observe now is doing a type of rolling motion okay and the same when i go in reverse so when you practice you know you gotta figure out you gotta imagine you got a wall next to you so the club stays as perpendicular to the ground as possible while your elbow comes in towards the midline as the club drop okay so pay attention to the hand position how much it goes up and down and the displacement towards the midline from my elbow yeah and then you can sort of like do fun stuff and i'm hauling the full grip okay so the full grip we've got two variations you could say you've got the hammer grip yeah perpendicular and this would be used as a resting position or transition position and then you've got the saber grip where the handle of the club is in the proponention of your forearm and kind of like all those moves around there using the saber grip okay so for hema they're the two main groups you need to master worry about and just have a firm grip but relaxed enough to be able to transition between those movements okay also important that you will build some strength by doing wrist circles which also do some direct work to strengthen your wrist and your fingers and your hands in general and again i'll put a link in the description to a circuit where you just follow along to a couple of times a week works great also if you're training for hematite don't just you know be lame and go around replicating sword moves with your heavy weighted club okay it's not a full product it's not full body program for hema so you need to do something more than just swing and twirl the clubs around okay thanks for watching remember to subscribe hit the

you gotta figure out you gotta imagine you got a wall next to you so the club stays as perpendicular to the ground as possible while your elbow comes in towards the midline as the club drop okay so pay attention to the hand position how much it goes up and down and the displacement towards the midline from my elbow yeah and then you can sort of like do fun stuff and i'm hauling the full grip okay so the full grip we've got two variations you could say you've got the hammer grip yeah perpendicular and this would be used as a resting position or transition position and then you've got the saber grip where the handle of the club is in the proponention of your forearm and kind of like all those moves around there using the saber grip okay so for hema they're the two main groups you need to master worry about and just have a firm grip but relaxed enough to be able to transition between those movements okay also important that you will build some strength by doing wrist circles which also do some direct work to strengthen your wrist and your fingers and your hands in general and again i'll put a link in the description to a circuit where you just follow along to a couple of times a week works great also if you're training for hematite don't just you know be lame and go around replicating sword moves with your heavy weighted club okay it's not a full product it's not full body program for hema so you need to do something more than just swing and twirl the clubs around okay thanks for watching remember to subscribe hit the notification bell leave us some comments or questions and we'll try to cover them next talk to you later [Music]\n\n\n## Endscreen\n    \n- [The Ace of Clubs program for heavy clubs, mudgars &
