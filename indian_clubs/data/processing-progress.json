a Persian there a Persian meal Persian exercise see a lot in Old School pictures military especially the British military we brought in the giras they're in India for a long time we learned from ancient warriors how to stay healthy and strong using what is essentially a levered weight so it's just a weight on a stick so most of the weight is here and the leverage means that even though it's just 2 lbs pulling against your hand against your arm this is why your arms are getting stronger stronger that levered weight adds up to more than just the 2 lbs now you're going to bend your elbows and rotate forward keeping your elbows bent close to your head you allow the clubs to rotate past your ears heels are still together toes out like a duck stomach up and in ABS tight Brea then through the nose forcefully out through the mouth then you're going to rotate in the opposite direction pulling them back you can see this is activating all the muscles in your forearm as you get a more powerful grip grip is a big part of stronger arms I use these to keep my arms and shoulders healthy I also use them to hit people harder for self-defense make your grab Ling better if you do Judo or Jiu-Jitsu or Western wrestling or Eastern wrestling so you 30 seconds in each Direction and you're going to go back your heels together to your swinging motion and this time as you come down you're

older stay safe from injuries your other workouts remember to suck your gut up and in keep your abs tight now we're going to do a very traditional swinging exercise this is called a mill going to start with this about hitching a ride make sure your thumb is sideways and not up don't ever put your hand on the side of your stick whether it's this stick or if you fight with sticks having your thumb on the stick think you're going to run into something you can break that bone right there so make sure your hands closed your palm is facing behind you then it comes up by bending your elbow as it swings up again you're going to let the weight of the Indian swinging club bring your arm back now open your elbow and cast so three motions one two this third one is like throwing a knife or casting a fishing pole you can cut it down to three motions once you start to get it let it get smooth that smoothness will bring speed you can repeat the Mantra slow as smooth smooth as fast remind yourself take your time with the weight the Indian swinging club do the work as you build stronger arms healthier shoulders after this hand for 30 seconds you're going to bring this one in warming up with this easy simple motion first this is the most important part of this motion facing sideways a lot of times when we work together I see you do this you turn your thumb up make sure it's here and then when you're going through it looks like this you're pulling your hand back so make sure you're here open cast slow as smooth smooth as fast take your time heels together stomach up and in ABS tight tuck your chin breathe in through the nose forcefully out through the mouth get your heart rate up getting healthy and strong stronger arms Indian swinging clubs you want to see the dimensions of my Indian swinging clubs these Persian meals check the link below in the description buy a pair there very inexpensive or make your own or you can start with a hammer I like a rubber mallet you can get up like 24 o 16 to 24 o usually they're 10 to 15 bucks at the hardware store or the do-it-yourself store get two of those and then work your way up to a fancy Indian swinging club and you can go heavy too heavy is a different kind of exercise but we can go over that later now after you've gone out with both arms I'm going to have you come in so instead of here and here we're going to go here

swinging club once you've done both arms in the reverse you're going to go back to that forward motion you're going to follow one with the other one stomach up and in ABS tight tuck the chin breathe

posture so you look younger you look leaner you're going to get stronger uh Na says love your videos appreciate you being here I really appreciate that good uh positive feedback please in the comment section if you would in the comment section not just the chat let me know are you training already with Indian swinging clubs and if so did you make your own like I started are you using sticks do you have something like this this is the lowest or something like that they change names all the time just from Amazon these are inexpensive are using hammers I sometimes we use hammers we're going to do a lot more grip strength training in the near future to work on that forearm as we redefine what it means to be strong and fit not just for overall health but also for self-defense and I want you to be able to hit hard and if you grab a hold of somebody I want them to feel it you know I want you to have a powerful grip we can get that using a lot of levered Weights this kind of stuff uh silent walk good to see you um but let me know in the comment section are you already working with these if you are what weight are you working and uh my recommendation always is to start light and work your way up if you're young and super fit I still recommend you start light there's a lot of benefit to using very heavy clubs but you have to do the right exercises there's certain exercises that you will do only with heavier clubs not only with heavier clubs there are certain exercises that you will avoid with super heavy clubs that can cause so much damage you have to get surgery and I don't want you to experience that so I want you to work your strength up with light gloves or you might already have been doing it for a while go heavy but if you're going to go heavy go heavy with a good coach so that you don't get injured but let me know in the comment section what are you working with now if you are you been thinking about it and if you are heavy what do you what exercises you do with the heavier clubs what exercises you do do you do my words are all rushing together with the lighter clubs put that in the comment section and then I will we're still going to work Tombo maybe later today I still have a video that I've been working on talking about my everyday carry and what that looks like three different concepts the mental training part what happens if you're in a non-permissive environment and then if you are in a permissive environment you can carry obviously you can carry your blade you can carry your self-defense tool what what do I carry cuz you've been asking me that anyway I'll see you guys in a little bit I'm headed to work",

upper arm your shoulders this is one of the best ancient self-defense and ancient strength training tools you can possibly use going to have you start with one in each hand as you grip your Indian swinging club your pinky finger will always come to the center of the ball here on the end and kind of cut it through the middle and your thumb will be down you will not put your thumb there you could hurt your thumb thumb you're always going to wrap it and when you hold your Indian swinging club don't squeeze it but keep it in a firm grip so you hold one in each hand you're going to Simply warm up by letting them swing behind your back and then up above your head as you do this motion you're going to keep your belly up and in your abs are tight tuck your chin a little bit breathe in through the nose out through the mouth and your feet are going to come together your Heels come together and your toes Point kind of sideways they int like a duck so heels together toes out stomach up and in ABS tight tuck your chin breathe in through the nose out through the mouth as you do this opening move this first Power move your beginner Indian swinging club workout you're going to do this for about 30 seconds you're going to feel your heart rate start to rise it's going to really improve your overall Fitness it's going to help your posture this going to make you hit a lot stronger for self-defense it's going to make your blocking better it's going to make your grip better if you do Jiu-Jitsu hey Garen it's good to see you again you're holding make sure your thumb is down now I'm going to have you bend your elbows and then rotate your clubs going forward first let them drop to the ground that'll bring your palms up to the sky back behind the head nice easy orbital spin both hands at the same time if you want to get fancy you can alternate I like to do them with the same time going forward first do this for about 30 seconds and then reverse it pulling it back letting it go behind you warming up your wrists strengthening your forearms you're going to get power in your forearm power in your grip power for striking for self-defense improved Fitness less pain in your joints stronger shoulders stronger forearms painfree elbows just pulling back like that then you're going to go back to this swinging motion again put your heels together toes out stomach up in ABS tight as you go forward you're going to let the spin happen and go down then you're going to pull it in reverse and up so you're adding to spin down and spin up going to increase your flexibility dramatically you're going to really increase the speed and the power of all your strikes for self-defense as long as you keep your stomach up and in ABS tight tuck the chin breathing in through the nose out through the mouth heels together toes out comes a standing Core workout and again you're going to do this for a good 30 seconds you can go longer if you like this is a beginner power workout with your Indian swimming clubs nice and simple now I want you to split your grip get rid of the spin for a minute on this next exercise and what you're doing is you're allowing it to go back farther than when you swing them at the same time you swing at the same time you'll be limited in your range of motion but when you split you'll be able to turn your shoulders keeping this in the center of your body you're going to increase the range of motion really stretching both forward and backward you're G to feel it in your shoulders in a really positive way as you feel yourself getting stronger remember to keep your stomach up and in ABS tight heels together toes pointed out this is also going to raise your heart rate until you might start to sweat improve your circulation getting healthier as you're getting [Music] stronger after 30 seconds we're going to let that one rest I want to show you one modification I like you to do for leg strength when you are practicing to defend yourself whether it's a punch or a palm strike or an elbow strike any type of strike is all coming through the feet through your legs through your spine through your core through the shoulders out through the arm and then you hit them so you're hitting from the ground up when you throw in an air squat you're going to activate all the muscles in the core but also in your lower body especially when you push your hips back like you're sitting down into a chair you don't have to go that low especially if you Lo lost Mobility over the years but when you add the Indian swinging clubs in this power workout to that squat it's going to stabilize you in a way that allows you to go a little bit lower it's you're going to activate more muscle fiber you're going get a better range of motion you're going to strengthen your knees you're going to strengthen your glutes especially as you age men especially get weak in the glutes flabby butt looks like you're holding a file folder back there as your posture deteriorates and falls apart just cuz you're sitting all the time so you add these exercises in it's going to activate your glutes your big butt muscles all the punches that come off the floor go through those powerful glutes you stabilize those hips you be knocking people out for self-defense simply because you added in this power Indian club swinging workout this beginner workout add some of these air squats with this basic swing and each one of these weighs 2 lbs that's not a lot it's not going to wear you out it's not going to build big beach muscles but it's going to give you strength and real strength to defend yourself with simply by swinging these things two lbs is really all you need you can even start one pound or just a stick in each hand get a broomstick cut it in half that's your starting Indian swinging club you want to move up something like this I put a link in the description that's where I get mine you can see what they cost they're super inexpensive it's an entire gym in your garage you here it's starting to take my breath away now back to traditional Indian swing club exercise going to get your heels together stomach up and in ABS tight we're going to bring one uh Indian club up in this position so that your forearm is perpendicular to the ground pointing to the sky your knuckles are flat so it's not like this but it's like this from this position you're going to swing it back out and by swing it I mean Let It Drop and do its own work under its own weight pulling your arm out you're just going to do this motion on one arm 15 to 30 seconds I like you to do time instead of counting repetitions the number doesn't really matter the number of times so much as the amount of time you keep tension on the muscles so we call it time under tension we wanted that to be the guide as we get older instead of reps when you're 18 years old you get big bodybuilder muscles go for reps of five or eight or 12 or whatever the fat is whatever you're trying to accomplish but as you get older make sure you've got about 30 seconds in there before you move on to get the full benefit now once you've done that on both hands you're going to come to this starting position you're going to open your chest just by opening your elbow and then you're going to cast and you're not going to hit yourself in the back of the head as a beginner I worried about that as a beginner you don't have to worry about that because when you open your elbow that's always going to that's always going to put the club Behind Your Head then you're going to cast it like you're casting a fishing pole or throwing a knife just going to cast it Let It Drop open the elbow cast it Let It Drop let it come all the way through the center of your body remember these Knuckles this is very important Knuckles are facing the sky the elbow the upper arm or the lower arm is perpendicular perpendicular to the ground once you get that it's three motions here's one here's two the cast is three we say slow as smooth smooth as fast so you're not going to power it up you're not going to push it Forward you're going to let the power and the speed come from the smoothness of each one of those motions once you've done that 30 seconds focus on that other arm elbow cast there's a big storm brewing outside I don't know if you can hear the thunder yet it's getting closer caused a bunch of tornadoes up north we'll see what happens down here normally sunny suthern Florida it's darker than it normally is this time of day because the clouds are so heavy stomach up and in ABS tight breathing in through the nose out through the mouth keep your heels together turn your toes out like a duck once you've done that for 30 seconds on the other arm go back to your first arm focus on think about it and reverse the motion so Palm facing behind you turn the hand up bring the elbow across Let It Drop so same motion Just In Reverse again slow as smooth smooth as fast when you're ready allow yourself to speed up but don't push it I want you to do this 30 seconds every time once a day once every other day within a few weeks you'll be a master of the basics you'll get so much value out of these Indian swinging clubs bring it to the other hand turn it elbow across remember this perpendicular that it drop I see the comments coming in I'm apologize I can't read them this far back I want you to be able to follow this flow the flow of this workout so want to con walk forward to read comments but I'll go back and read them later appreciate you being here I appreciate your chat now once you've done that on the other side 30 seconds we're going to go back to the first hand and then we're going to chase it with the second hand so what that looks like is I'm going to come here I'm going to follow one with the other one stomach up and in ABS tight breathe in through the nose out through the mouth heels together like a duck toes out speed it up when you want to by the way there's no way to do these workouts wrong you'll just learn every time you do it you'll learn a little bit more until you get some basic level of proficiency then there's still always more to learn grow don't beat yourself up keep your ego in check you're not supposed to be good at it at first if you don't quit you'll be good at it eventually then just reverse it so bringing one out following it the next one comes the rain and then the third one they come in and out at the same time each time you do this one time you'll have one elbow or one fist in front of the other one the next time through put the other one in front keep your heels together here we go rain's dropping stomach an in ABS tight in the comment section if you're already using Indian swinging clubs just put how many pounds you're use pounds or kilograms my recommendation to start light one pound is enough after about 6 weeks maybe move up to 2 lbs slow as smooth smooth as fast take your time then switch it into the reverse now on the next workout we're going to throw in a sinal pattern coming from Filipino martial arts might throw in one or two and then the other thing I want to show you next time we work out together with these is getting more of the body and there's so many ways to use these Indian swinging clothes this is just the tip of the iceberg but I should say and if you learn how how to do this first and then this second and this third and I know I didn't teach him that word and then this fourth every once in a while you throw in some of these and then finally you learn how to do your Mill both alternating same time forward and reverse if you can do those you'll master the basics and you'll be able to teach anybody else and you'll feel the value the benefit in your shoulders in your elbows and especially in the grip and then all your strikes and if you fight with a cane if you fight with a stick if you fight with a knife all your strikes all your techniques if you punch if you grapple everything is going to be so much better because of the power of these beginner Indian clubs I think the rain I think we rained out I don't think we can hear I can't hear myself so um um if you have any questions put that in the comment section or if you have recommendations or you know a lot of you guys know things that I don't know about especially about things like this put that in the comment section let's create a dialogue in our um Community our virtual training Dojo put in the comment section are you using them already if you do what weight do you use wood wood feels so much better these these have been around forever though if you need a parot in the uh the description I'll see you guys on the next one thank you",

I love it.\n\nI'm using 1lbs poly clubs in this practice video.\n\nyou can learn about choosing your first clubs here -\n\nit's a little little practice today because it's a new skill all right so we're going to learn the movement and then you can practice as much as you need okay how do we know which is outward and inward think about the full moon all right my full moon drops from the top outwards if I'm doing a half moon I can keep going on this pattern it Dr drops then it slices halfway drops out slices halfway okay we're going to start add in a tea the mace is going to drop when I come to the end here I'm going to turn the mace Palm down at a right angle sorry turn the Club Palm down at a right angle so it's here and then I'm going to slice across okay so it drops down bend my elbow when I get to here across this way Hammer grip right slice it out so this would be an outward Half Moon cuz I'm coming in slicing out in slicing out okay try with the other side straight Palm down in Palm down flick the club to behind you slice it out down flick slice down flick slice let's try both together both arms out Palms down here saber grip down flick right see both clubs are pointing backwards now yeah then slice okay back to my te shoulders packed okay don't be holding up here shoulders packed drop in slice if you can remember change which hand which arm is on the top okay same thing for like when we do our hearts yeah we going to change which one's on the top and our moons same thing goes with half Moons I come out Palm goes up Club goes back okay then I pull my elbow in slice across I end up in this Bend time position I stretch out come to my tea back bend and slide SCE out back bend and slice okay let me show you the other arm here Palm up Club goes back right so here Bend and slice out back bend and slice out back bend and slice okay let's try both arms going inward so inward slice inward slice inward slice inward slice okay one of my favorite additions to the half moon is a helicopter wrist roll okay you know how I just said point the club back if you're going in slice and then down okay if you want to do a helicopter wrist roll the opposite applies so from the straight I'm going to go Club first going to bend my elbow Club goes close to me I let it go all the way around and I finish in the flick out then it drops tip goes forward rotate the hand drop it out tip goes forward okay let's try the other way the same thing applies so I go down instead of going back to slice if I'm doing a helicopter wrist roll I go forward that means Palm up forward let the tip curl let the tip curl move your arm and right at the end it flecks out okay in forward tip curls tip curls out then you get this real lovely kind of spin on it okay really fun let's try the other side so an inward first which means we're going to go drop in then smooth out drop in then smooth out because this would be a whole inward Moon so tilt forward Palm is down to do the helicopter wrist roll and finishes on and up let's go two hands at a time for your helicopter wrist rolls on a half moon start out first off we're going to do outwards so outward Moon yeah which means we're going to drop first drop first for the half moon helicopter wrist roll means we're going to go Palms up Palms up finish Palms down drop bend your elbows tilt the clubs forward Palms up finish straighten them out T squeeze your glutes stack your shoulders good okay drop again drop flick forward and out drop flick forward and out drop flick forward and out let's go inwards inwards we're going to do the wrist roll first then drop through tilt forward then drop through so Palms down clubs go forward in my hand Hammer grip first then I let them keep going as I bend my elbows let them keep going okay have a practice of that and let me know how you go have a good day",

          "transcriptText": "This is a breakdown for a beginner level Indian Club flow made by \"Frankenlegs\" Coach Zack Yanyk for Steel Mace Building Blocks.\n\nGreat for Shoulder, wrist, and elbow health and mobility!\n\nWelcome back to another Indian club flow breakdown with Coach Zach. This one's going to start out with an in-n-out helicopter to switch us from side to side in this beginner's single club flow. After that, we're going to add an Indian cross transition. To do so, we're going to lift that club up, let it drop down behind us, drive that elbow across the face and through the heart to create a back swing and to change the momentum, taking us from an outward motion to an inward motion. While I have the time here, you're going to see me demonstrate it three times on each side. I would recommend you get it down before you move to the next move, before you add the next combo or, you know, uh, do many, many reps. After that though, you'll add in an outward heart shape and an inward heart shape. So, how that works is you throw that outward heart shape right after the helicopter. Then you find the Indian cross transition to change your momentum. And then you find your inward Indian cross before helicoptering it back out the other side. Again, that's heart shape. Indian cross transition. And then inward hard shape before we find that helicopter. In those heart shapes, of course, we're looking for those nice grip switches. We're owning our angles. We're owning our lines. We're searching for our Y shape both in that inward and in that outward. Of course, as mentioned, making sure we're getting those nice clean grip switches because that's what really makes the magic happen as far as cleaning the flow up and of course getting the benefit in those wrists. But after that, we're going to go ahead and add low elbow circles. So, we'll add an outward before the outward heart shape, and then we'll add an inward before the inward heart shape. So it goes helicopter then low elbow circle heart shape Indian cross transition low elbow circle heart shape before we find that helicopter back to the other side. Of course it's an outward low first and then the inward low after. But let's talk about that elbow circle. We're going to want to make sure we're trying our best to keep our elbow pinned to the ribs. Play around with your palm angles. That's the key here. Try and be aware of where your palm is facing and experiment with what makes this move smoothest for you. Of course, this one is just going to stick in that saber grip the whole time, but the sharper we can get that saber grip, the smoother the movement will be and the more control we'll have over that palm angle. [Music] After that, we're going to go ahead and add our final move, which is our full moon or shoulder circle. So, same idea. We do an outward one and then the low elbow circle. Then we find our heart. Then we do the Indian cross transition. Then it's inward, inward, full, inward, low elbow, inward heart, and then the helicopter switches. So we have full moon low elbow circle heart shape Indian cross transition inward full moon elbow circle heart shape and then the helicopter transfers us over to the other side. Then again it's outward full outward low elbow outward heart Indian cross transition switches momentum. So now it's inward full inward elbow and inward heart before of course that helicopter switches us back the other way. Now, as I was saying it earlier, I'm demonstrating just three times per. I would recommend you get it down before you move on. Or at the very least, get it to 10 times per side before you switch it up. Get the practice in. That's where the magic happens. Of course, the joy of repetition. Now, if you want to level this one up, there is all sorts of opportunity for both the standard mulinet wrist roll as well as the inside wrist roll. I encourage you to experiment and play with that and find what you can add to bring it to the edge of your comfort zone, whatever that is for you. One way or another though, I hope you enjoy this flow. You enjoy the practice with these movements. Thank you so much. Have a fantastic rest of whatever it is for you.",

          "transcriptText": "Originally filmed for Indian Clubs 1.5 and re-edited for Steel Mace Building Blocks, this is a beginner's instructional video for one of the most popular Indian Clubs moves out there- The Snake.\n\nall right y'all it is time for snakes I know a lot of people are very interested in this movement this is a cool one first thing we're going to have to talk about is the grip so there's a secret hidden grip when it comes to the snake I like to refer to it as a snake grip oh how I'm going to have my hand is like so thumb and fingers wrapped around index finger is cued over top of the head or of the palmel of the Indian club we can see this for a larger palmel or smaller hands two fingers might want to be involved the index and the uh middle finger this is of course totally doable this will work the snake is what I like to refer to as a work it's not quite as tricky as it looks it looks very fancy but in reality a single turn snake or even a double turn snake isn't too tricky of a movement it all comes down to this right here so if you can do this circle you can do a snake now what this circle is I start with the club hidden behind my arm I'm in that hook grip that snake grip the club is hidden behind my arm I do a circle to turn my hand around my palm is now facing forward the club is in tight this helps me go into my uh heart-shaped style elbow drive and then when I open up just like in a heart shape I let the club turn now in that single turn I'm letting it fall into this position so I'm holding it just with my index and my thumb essentially those other fingers are there for help but they don't really need to be the club isn't really moving it's opening into that position my hand turns around and pins it back it comes back down I'm in that start position turn the arm around open up like a heart shape flick turn Catch start to smooth it out flick turn catch let the club turn flick turn catch let the club turn flick turn catch let the club turn so we see that is just this circle here hard shape extension pinning the club back to the arm turn it around open it up catch it smooth strong control that's going to activate those wrists going to get those forearms firing of course it's going to be great for those shoulders as well get those down get that single Club down like I've talked about in other videos uh 10 minimum if you can do 10 Clean you can do it try and go for more though once you can do one try two so it's that same deal that double circle that flicking catch clubs come in they're hidden behind they turn around they open up turn and catch smooth controlled start to seam it up I like to extend either to a y or a t depending on what I'm trying to activate if I'm really trying to open up those shoulders of course it'll go to the Y but if I'm really f focus on just rocking the movement I'll go to the T mix it up now once you can do the double The Next Step would be to alternate it and again that just comes from putting in the time putting in the practice but the reverse snake Club starts forward now I'm going to rotate out to put the club behind my arm so we see that so in that forward snake I rotate towards my Center Line for the uh reverse snake the club starts in front of my arm it comes out hides behind my arm and lifts up it's that same style of hold that same flick turn catch and pin it comes in turns to hide flicks open so club's facing me I rotate out let the club turn let it turn flick it up let it turn flick it up so see how that club's pointed in my hand is up it turns around so the club can hide it's pinned against that form for the lift flick turn catch and smoothing it out flick turn catch flick turn catch flick turn catch the whole snake is right here that little circle to get the club around the arm arm is what makes it what it is once we can do one of course we take it to two once we can do two of course we try alternating good so on the movement know the movement on the movement conquer it earn it own it so those are the snakes again it all comes down to that turn sometimes you'll see people just turn the club around the arm that's an option another option is that nice Circle there play with them add to them see where we can take them you're going to get frustrated snakes can be tricky remember it's that turn that small turn is what really makes it happen that catch against the arm is very key if we can get that nice catch and we get a nice turn we're going to have a nice snake put the practice in get the Reps in it's the joy of repetition isue the more you get to do something the better you are at it what better excuse to do something more if you're not very good at it so if you're not very good at this do this Lots get good at it if you're already good at it fantastic do it lots get better at it Joy of repetition skills need to be practiced practice the skill add it to some other stuff build new things later on you're going to see a different pattern called The Clock Tower the clock tower is a pattern that I believe I came up with I don't know if I saw it somewhere in a d acted it but I'm pretty sure I came up with it you'll notice a lot of few a lot of things that are very similar to a snake and that's because I put a ton of time in with the snake so put a ton of time in figure out new patterns figure out your own patterns but watch for that clock tower practice those snakes and I'll see you in the next video",

Please whatsapp on +91 82788 16690 or email on trusha91@gmail.com\n\nThe practice of Karlakattai/Mudgar & Gada helps to improve musculoskeletal strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular strength, joint mobility and neuromuscular co-ordination.\n\nFeel free to write to me on trusha91@gmail.com to place an order for a customised Karlakattai/Mudgar or Gada.\n\nIf you are inerested to join my Live Online class then click on the link below\n\n[Music] hi my name is trusa I'm a senior mayam and karakai coach and I've been teaching both mayam and karakai for almost six years now in this video I want to talk about an incorrect and quite an unproductive way of uh practicing with your karakai or mudar which I have been observing has become quite prevalent among the practitioners and that is focusing your training heavily on uh The Swinging function of Kai now there are two unproductive things that are happening here and I think I have discussed about this in one of my previous videos also while explaining about body rotation so the first thing is since your training is heavily focused on swinging you're constantly taking help of the momentum generated by swinging to move your klak and hence you are missing out on the essential part of the practice which is building muscular skeletal strength which is not going to come if your practice focuses heavily on swinging kakai the second thing that is going to happen and especially if you are a beginner it increases the chances of injuries so uh to give you a quick example if your practice of body rotation looks like this where you're swinging kakai heavily when your kakai reaches here if you do not have good neuromuscular coordination and strength then there is a possibility that you can lose control over the movement of karakai and that can cause injury to your shoulder elbow and wrist so just now we saw how these unproductive things are happening if your training is uh focused heavily uh on The Swinging function of kakati so now the question is what does a good training session look uh look like a good training session uh which combines uh mayam and karakai in an effective and intelligent way will train you on uh six basic human movement patterns there are actually seven uh essential human movement patterns which are push pull hinge lunge squat rotate and Locomotion now the seventh one Locomotion uh which includes walking and climbing now that is something that you can practice on your own separately but a good kagai training session will train you on these first six uh human movement patterns so that's how a good training session looks like and if you are interested in training correctly feel free to get in touch with us uh and join any of our uh online train training and if you are interested in teaching kagai properly then uh get in touch with me uh for the next teacher training course which is starting from 27th April so if you found this video useful please share it with other practitioners also and I will see you in the next video thank you [Music] n [Music]",

I am slowly learning to start off our workouts using the clubs and a routine. I try to alternate between upper and lower body moves. I got pretty winded half way through this one.\n\nWe'll do a couple of 360s. Right hand on top. Dump it over your left shoulder. It should, if you do it right, it should just sort of flip right back on front. They can't really see you. Okay. Now, what we're going to do is catch it with your left hand at the handle and then just curl it five times. Keep your right hand still bent. Four. Then when you come back down, your right left hand's on top and you dump over your right shoulder. We'll do five of those. Two. Three. Four. And then on the fifth one, take your right hand out and grab it. And then do your curls. Two. At least there's a bridge. That is nice. Okay, now we're going to alternate. Okay, so go this way and then do a curl and then flip it back. So you get a little bit of a flow going. Okay, last one. Oh, that was not right. Okay, park it in the middle. Hold straight out. Just try to hold it there for a few seconds. Count of five. One, two, three, four, five. Now squat down. Raise up on your toes if you can. Do five of those. Should be My arms are burning. Five. That burns. My arms. Okay, now we're going to do um um the two hand press. So, put starting position here. Dump it over your left shoulder. And then what you want is your, you know, my palms backwards. Okay. And then straight up. two five of those. It gets harder if you get in further away from the head. Now put your left hand on top. Dump it on your right shoulder. Okay. Now one, two. This right shoulder is kind of messed up on me for Okay, parked it. Now we're going to do that um kneeling backwards. So you right hand should be on top. Dump your left shoulder. Catch it. So then the head goes back. So your right hand should be on your left knee. Then you slide your left hand down. right shoulder grabs it and then come down. Okay, we'll do five of those. One. Wait. Two. I guess this would be two. Once you get into the feel of it, three, man. Okay, we need a second. That's good. It's getting me winded. I want to do a one arm press instead of a two arm press. The closer your hand is by the head, the easier. But what you'll do when you flip like a bice the first one. Now what you want is we're going to have it like like this. So the head's in front of you. So when you lift up, it rotates out. Try that. Pull them up. Now move your hand in a little. Okay. Grab this other one. Well, that's why I was trying to get the right weight. This one's almost too heavy for me. You want this one? No, this is okay. I got it. And we'll start ourselves here. There he is. And left shoulder. Wait a minute. It's in the wrong. I didn't feel right. Something's wrong. Well, that's all right. You just want that way. It's on the That way it kind of flows. That's good. Then you drop your left hand on top right shoulder and catch it. That's all right. Well, you feel that. So, that hand should be the one that's pressing up. Yeah. It's like the bicep curl, but take it on up and rotate it around. Do it. You hear that? I do. I thought it was Hillary for a minute, man. Okay, now we want to do our side lunge. Okay. Oh man. So, right out. There you go. Keep your back kind of up. Don't bend over. You want to really feel it in your hamstring. Oh man. I guess some people will hold it up top, too. I don't I like putting it down. You guys feel that in your hamstring? Yeah, it feels amazing. It's a good stretch. Oh man. One more to the other side. Okay, this one's going to be um I think like this, catch it, and then I think take it too far instead of bend it down. Say some sort of a warp thing. Okay. So, you flip it around real slow. Grab it and Man, that really feels it in my back. Wow. Okay, we'll do one more leg. We're going to do the curtsy, which is another stretch, but loop it around and then cross behind and over. Come back. I think that's pretty good, guys. Good one.",

Please like, subscribe, and leave me comments!\n\nGo to pasquinilli.com to get updates and curriculum checklists and guides.\n\nsticks or also known as Ki sticks our knee sticks we're going to use sticks to defend ourselves and you can train with a pair of sticks like this or even just one stick learn how to defend yourself fighting with sticks and then you can find sticks anywhere we're also going to talk about the expand over baton which is almost exactly the same length as a traditional collie or a screa stick I put links in the description below if you want to see what the dimensions are so you're going to start with one if you have two you're going to start with two one in each hand you have one just start with one and as a warmup I want you to just swing them so that you can warm up your shoulders all of these strikes are going to come off of the shoulder or through the Shoulder Through the elbow through the wrist and the joints through all of this we want to warm it up first you're just going to do this basic swinging motion that's going to get your heart rate up a little bit pump the blood get the sovial fluid into the joints warming up so you stay safe from injury now when you fight there's no time to warm up you're just going to hit the guy for self-defense smashing but in practice when you're learning how to do stick fighting for self-defense when you do stick fighting training you need a good proper warm up to stay safe from injury we're going to start to move fast hit hard sometimes you'll hit maybe like a stack of tires a pole a tree a punching bag and then you want to keep those joints safe from injury so that you can hit harder and harder and move faster for self-defense one of the great things about these sticks is it gives you reach Advantage you get somebody coming around attacking you with a bladed weapon something like this maybe a little longer a little shorter either thrusting or slashing and you have one of these poles which is usually one of these fighting sticks about as long as your arm your entire arm you can hit him before he can hit you so you have the advantage of reach and we're going to talk about how to defend against a blade here in a second the second warm up move before we get into the strikes is turning hello Doug good to see you Doug says Canada approves of what's going on this morning I myself I'm starting to feel un burdened by what has been just a little election day po post elction humor but as you do this motion keep your hand closed and you're going to rotate out you rotate in and out and all that's doing is warming your wrists up up it's going to build power in your grip so that when you strike for self-defense you're going to be able to hold on to it better after you do that spinning warm up go back to the swinging and then you're going to spin down and spin up we're not going to go into all of the traditional Filipino martial arts FMA that you might do all the moves something called Cali which is kind of a weeding pattern you can learn this this will help break up the monotony of training with your strikes but really for a warm up all you need is this spinning motion and Swinging swinging and spinning to build power in all of your basic strikes for self fense you can do it going down and up you can do it going forward I'll slow down a lot you see all I'm doing is turning out turning in you can then alternate that doing one hand at a Time come forward miss the comment go put it up again and then if you want you can do it at the same time and that's just a look fancy that's not you're going to use that in a fight when you start doing stick fighting training not everything has to be a self-defense move think about a boxer who skips rope or hits the speed bag or hits the the punching bag the boxer doesn't take any of those tools with him into the boxing ring in the same way you're not going to necessarily fight with this this motion but that's kind of like cross training with like a boxer it's going to get your heart rate up it's going to uh build timing and distance speed and power increase the speed of your strikes sometimes you can add a spin and then make your strike a lot faster so you will use it but we're going to start with these um mrgs about these sticks particularly there is a link in the description to um a martial arts store that has a lot of different kinds of esrea sticks these uh sticks specifically are not made anymore so but I think you can get a version of them the company that makes these are combative K MB a ti.com and they make a lot of they have a lot of gnarly knives over there too they make a lot of like expandable baton they have a lot of not expandable baton but like um a lot of fancy tools like this this always reminded me of kind of like the Daredevil but that's the basic warmup I want you to do I'm going to put these down and show you how we're going to use them for self fence because that's really what we're talking about we're not talking about traditional uh learning a traditional martial art we're talking about practicing hitting someone stick fighting for self-defense stick fight training so from here starting in either hand doesn't matter because you're going to do both hands with the same number of strikes I'm going to start here in in my right you can do right or left if it's in your right put your right foot forward if it's in your left put your left foot forward you're going to make yourself a smaller Target you're always going to fight from behind these sticks so the stick is between you and the thread remember that never having any wide strikes these wide strikes are not going to work CU he'll close the distance and you'll wrap your arm around them you'll it barely hit them at all if if if you do hit him but if you're coming from the shoulder and you're fighting and you're keeping that stick between you and him he has to get through your stick so you're going to hit him you're going to go into him um yeah klie esrea arnice are all you know three different names sakal you can find it under Sall s i k l salot s i l all from the Filipino martial arts the diaspora of the mo he K Kingdom which was more you know so Indonesia um all over Asia you'll find about this length of a stick sticks and knives and they do you know when the the knife comes out of your hand the stick comes out of your hand they also do a lot of hand to hand a lot of Filipino martial arts also use a lot of je do you'll see a lot of Bruce Lee style in there so the first thing you have to see here is you're going to choke up a little bit and that's so that you have this ability to catch strip you can strip his weapon out of his hand you can catch and trap his hand you can also strike with it Christina asked uh wood or metal which is better it's personal preference if I like I like wood to start um especially retan which isn't technically wood it's grass and um rtin are what you'll find the most if you check the link below in the description and that store or I think most of them are retan there are some that are Hardwoods but go light because you want to get your techniques really fast and clean and then you want to learn how to hit and Ran's not going to break so you want to be able to um train with a stick and then use any stick so this is the whole point of stick fighting training is not necessarily to carry if I carry these walking down the street in an urban area I look like a threat right you might be able to stash him in a backpack like you're one of the Ninja Turtles or Daredevil or whatever or you might be in a situation where something happens you need to defend yourself and your family and there's sticks in your environment and you have to think outside the box not a wood stick that fell off of a tree although that might be what it is it might be you're at the gas station and there's that stick that you use to clean the windshield off with the squeegee on one side and the sponge on the other side it might be that you're in a restaurant and there's um in the kitchen there are spatulas and tongs and big spoons that are all longer maybe not this long but almost as long made out of metal or made out of wood that you can use to defend yourself you might break off the leg of a wooden chair or a table you might um be at the beach you might have an umbrella with you that's about this this long or a little longer or a little shorter you if it's one of those expandable ones you can extend it then you have some striking then it's going to break but it's better than nothing especially if he pulls out a weapon a knife but there sticks everywhere and let's do this let's put in the comment section not just the the chat but in the comment section put in the sticks that you can think of in your daily environment where I work there are I work on a campus lots of different buildings every building I go into every room I look around and I find at least two or three sticks that I would pick up and if I had to defend myself with a stick I also carry openly because of my job I'm security so I carry um I also have a blade on me all the time I also have a couple other tools that we won't go into but then I know how to fight with sticks I know how to fight with any length of sticks and I want you to learn how to fight too all right so from here you choke up a little bit that gives you more striking surface the first thing that I want you to practice is this coming off off your shoulder think of striking Temple to his jaw or the clavicle through his ribs or maybe his uh ribs through the outside of his hip but coming through at that basic angle and you can strike his Temple you strike his jaw you his hand is holding that knife or he's punching he's choking you can break his bones and his hand you can smash that hand you can break his elbow you can smash his ribs you go down to his knees maybe it's a vicious animal attacking your dog and you can strike down into his face into his his nose or whatever so you have all these off of this basic first angle first angle is off the same shoulder second angle is off the other shoulder so those are the first two angles in which you practice you put them together now you're making this V and then you just practice over and over for a good 30 seconds or more and each time going faster and hitting harder so that when you need it you've already done it you've already hit hard and fast and then later once you find a surface to strike then that adds another dimension because then you're going to get the rebound effect where it bounces when in your hand and you're going to learn how to control that so coming off that shoulder striking down the next set or coming up at an angle think rib to clavicle or jaw to Temple coming up this way and Palm is facing the sky so that when you run into his body for self-defense it goes through your hand and doesn't come out good morning G Carlton if your hands facing the wrong way your palms down it's going to strip it popping your fingers right off just like that so from here you're coming straight up this way and then the opposite hip coming off then you're going to put those four together so down two up two angle one angle two angle three four coming down and coming up always keeping the stick between you and your opponent then on the other side coming down coming up because we want to do both sides evenly and like before starting to increase the speed and the power in each strike and making sure that you're keeping them tight you're coming back to your shoulders and you're coming off your hips and and then the next two coming straight across Temple jaw body hand ribs stomach knees but a horizontal strike and then back coming the other way Palm up Palm down cross the body and back put those together one two three four five six and then we're going to add seven coming straight down cracking them on top of it always head for selfdefense um with your stick stick fighting training so a vertical strike you can also do a vertical strike coming straight up so don't hit yourself in the face so we have two down two up to horizontal vertical down vertical up or instead of vertical up I like to add a jabbing motion coming up into his throat into his jaw into his nose into his solar plexus coming up this way by the way I know and you ask me this from time to time if you wanted to train with a tool like this you can practice those same basic angles with one of these so I'm not going to do a video specifically on this but if you also carry one of these you can basically you can do you do the same thing with this one now you can see there are other other angles that you can you can do with one of these that you might not do with these but you can it's all basic Stripes um and if you want if you want to go back and slow that down a little bit I'm trying to beat the algorithm and not get demonetized based on techniques with that tool so think down two up two across back down and then up and this this slap that you'll see a lot of Filipino guys Filipino martial arts guys do um it's uh it's two things it it it helps them when they start when you start do trapping it also if you're fighting with one of these will help you get the knife back out um just FY just for your information all right now after those basic strikes and you practice those I want you to think about this holding with two hands that you're doing a push-up and smashing especially this hard piece of metal this is aircraft aluminum you can be metal wood it doesn't matter because you're going against soft tissue you're going against his nose his teeth you're moving him back once you move him back you can box the ears because by grabbing it here you've closed that Loop and you have more leverage so you can strike here I want you to also think Irish shalele style twisting striking fast it's a fast explosive strike coming off of both sides you can see once you start to add the turn of your shoulders you're going to get more distance you're going to hit him farther away or you're going to go through him more and it's going to increase the power and the speed of that strike seeing how close I can get to the camera before I break my phone um Renee Rene ask what if he grab stick don't let him grab his stick Renee but if he does get your other hand on it right away and twist and then push if he's pulling on your stick he's pulling it back this way you let him have it literally by moving forward toward him and then wherever you have your hands if his hands in the middle and you can grab on the other side twist like that then either push down and when you do this use your whole body so that you're engaging the big core muscles against his arm muscles and his shoulder muscles you want your big muscles against his little muscles so you're pushing down you can also push up by turning your hips and maybe just maybe you'll smash them on the bottom of his his jaw his tongue will be there bite his tongue off or smash his teeth break his teeth out of his face for self- offense and then push coming through his throat or throwing through his face um once I reopen the school after I get my other hip replaced I'll have a partner and I'll show you what that looks like when someone grabs it I'll have him grab it I'll grab his and I'll show you that you know even if I'm bigger than he is I'm assuming that I'll be bigger but maybe he'll beer I don't know uh depending on who we get to do that you can still apply these basic principles of twisting or turning and pushing turning lifting coming up this way and it's simply because you're you're not fighting him where he's fighting if he's pulling and you're trying to pull back and he's stronger than you you're going to lose you're getting a tug of war your body's shaking if he's pulling back and you're giving it to him and you turning at the same time now all of a sudden his energy is coming this way he's not resisting that and you have to move fast cuz he will resist as soon as he feels it then you can drop it raking down his face and then jab him with two hands up under his chin or push and smash his teeth from this position holding two hands pushing boxing twisting that hand smacking really hard also holding this with a a little bit here on the bottom we have these basic strikes that we went over also jab straight in think of a reverse jab he's behind you smash here you can smash and push hit his groin smash his knee hit him in the jaw smash the side of his head with the length uh this is silent wild gas is that this aluminum this one is aluminum here's its partner so you can hear I think they're they're Hollow but then they have caps on the on the end it's uh aircraft grade is what I was told but again this comes from combative KB a.com um if you want a link my my uh what I would suggest you do at the beginning when I first got these they cut me up a lot because they weren't um they weren't properly you know they were they were uh really sharp so I've dled the just by using them with my rough skin over time but I would recommend retan R A TT an I think and there's a link in the description to rettin also the next one that I want to show you which is one of my [Music] favorites just because you see him everywhere these days we might see him in the next few days pop out with some bad characters using them uh law enforcement most of law enforcement guys I know they won't they won't pull these out anymore if they do carry them I was talk the guy the guys I work with every day none of them carry them at all but this is the expandable baton and it's the exact same length or close to it yeah I think it's the same length as the colli or Screaming stick and col and scre sticks can come in different lengths like 26 28 24 if you're a kid they have teen which are thinner and then they have the larger if you're an adult um it really doesn't matter what stick you start with but the expandable baton is the same length as the extremist stick and you can carry it concealed and S Christina ask why don't the police use them some police still do but a lot of them don't use them because of all of the cameras all the defund the police all of the animosity that has been just heaped onto our law enforcement they don't want to lose their home they don't some of them I've talked to some people in certain departments I won't mention which ones they are locally who say we don't get out of the car anymore unless someone actively calls us we don't Patrol like we used to to have a presence because we don't want to be the next news story because we're doing our jobs and then it's misinterpreted or it's uh taken advantage of by the media to make us look like the bad guys and so they won't use these because to use them effectively it's a lot of this against somebody who's resisting arrest so they use either a taser or they have they use their firearm and so a lot more people are getting hurt just because of the way we've treated law enforcement we being the society um yeah Renee says maybe that'll change soon and I agree let's hope so let's hope that we can cuz I talk to these guys every day and they are facing like the department I work with with they are undermanned every Department that I talk to around here and this is an area I'm in Florida where there's a lot of support for law enforcement and it's not just the defund movements that has pulled so many people out it's this whole demographic shift where a lot of people retiring kids aren't coming into the profession and it doesn't pay enough the rent here for like a one bedroom is 2500 bucks a starting cop can make 60 Grand that's not enough money to pay for it and you know you can't live and how can you be a grown man or a grown woman protecting and and serving putting your life on the line and you can't afford to live that's ridiculous but anyway so it's a lot of different factors and um the bottom line is you need to be your own first responder being able to defend yourself with sticks that's why we do stick fighting training for self-defense so with this stick and I'm going to go over it simply it's it's the same moves as the collie stick that's why I said you can or the scream of stick you can learn to fight with any stick pick up a stick you can carry in certain places you have to check the laws in your area whe you this some places you need a conceal carry permit I have one of those I'm also in an open or a permitless state where you don't need one but to carry one of these you can stuff this in a bag you can put it on your shirt put it in a pocket when it's closed to close them you have to hit them on a hard surface to break the friction there are two kinds this is the friction kind the other kind is like springloaded you hit a button and pops out hit a button pops back in I've only ever used springloaded I don't know how or um friction style I don't know how the other ones work I mean I know how they work in principle I don't know if they're as good as I like this one but you have this um Christine ask is it not legal to carry it's not legal to carry in certain places I'm pretty sure you can't carry this in Canada at all you but you can't carry this in Canada if you can open it with one hand it's not legal um oh Christina says she's in uh security she doesn't have a firearm so you have to get creative yeah in order to defend yourself because some security are there just to pay attention and then call law enforcement in but that doesn't mean that when you call law enforcement the guy's not going to close the distance and start to hurt you while you're waiting for the police to respond 3 to 4 minutes later and yeah they get there but by then it might be too late so this is something you can use or like I said you can find other sticks in your environment that are the same length if they won't allow you to carry this so from here coming off the shoulder same exact angles as we trained with the other one you cannot do this because if you hit them with Force it's going to collapse and you're going to have a short stick again but you can can be closed and then Jam them with the the closed one and then pop it back open you can also pull it and smash him back but same thing as soon as Force hits this the vibrations enough it's going to start to collapse so as long as you know that you know it might collapse on you but you can do all the boxing you can do the rolling of your hand you hit them with this side that's where all the weight is that's going to hit a lot harder than that side does but it's basically these techniques now there are come-along techniques come-along techniques are when you maybe twist his arm behind his back or you come up and you apply pressure and and twist but that's not what we're going over we're not law enforcement trying to apprehend we're just doing stick fighting training to defend ourselves against a thug or a punk or an aggressive person who is off out of their mind who's trying to take your life your dignity your freedom and we know that God gives us right to self-de defense so we're defending ourselves stick fighting training for self-defense that's why we do that but um to use this it's very simple and to get good at using it practice those basic angles and as long as you remember the general rule that you're going to fight from behind your stick and that all angles this angle might be to the head but it might also be to the body and it can also go down to the knee so when you do practice practice these angles super tight coming from your shoulder off your body never from out here if you swing out here and he closes the Gap your arm wraps around him and you never hit him if you come here and he closes that distance he runs right into your stick and you're going to hit him every time so always fight behind your stick stick practicing these angles once you practice one side practice the other side slow as smooth smooth as fast start slow and then gradually increase speed faster and faster and faster if you're on the ground with your stick Christina ask what you find yourself on the ground with the stick if uh this is one of he's coming in to you know run up and kick you in the face or stomp on your head you can use this to block that motion you can also from your back strike now you're not going to have as much strength this is something the Brazilian jiu-jitsu teaches is like the 10 points of uh contact I forget exactly how they say it but the idea that if you're standing on your feet and you can throw a punch or swing a stick you have the maximum amount of force that you can generate so their goal in Brazilian jiu-jitsu is to close the distance wrap you up take you to the ground and get you down to the point you've seen it where they're sitting on top of somebody and all they have is their wrist left so they went from 10 to one this one little joint and you can't hurt somebody you know even if you got your hand closed you can annoy them but you're going to knock knock somebody out standing you anybody I can teach you how to knock somebody out I don't care how big or how small how young or how old you are I can teach almost anybody how to knock somebody out if they're standing on their feet and their timing and distan is right and you have to train a little bit but if you're on your on on your back now it's not likely you're going to be fighting a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt or even a blue belt or a purple belt it's more likely you're going to be fighting a crazed addict or um a road rage or uh enraged by what's happening in the world right now a crazy person or a a violent person who is getting paid to burn things to the ground because the people paying them yeah silent walk said some idiot on the bus got arrested because they had their their knife open and now everybody feels threatened there's the famous news story in New York right now where the young Marine uh former Marine defended himself and the others from a guy who threatened to kill everybody who was an addict and um he put him in a choke hold police got there he still had a pulse he still had a pulse for a long time he was still breathing and because he didn't he didn't break his neck he didn't uh uh you know crash his his throat and it's another one of those things where the guy doing the right thing is getting punished because the in that area they they want to punish the good guys and let the bad guys you know give the victims all the rights or the criminals all the rights anyway the question was what do you do if you're on the ground you can also smash his feet there are a lot of nerves in The Shins go for The Shins if you can hit him in the groin go for the groin if he's coming down to jump on top of you go for his face while you're on the back if you can get stay on you know on your back stay on your back and then you turn to the side um I've got a few videos on here where I show you how to get up from the ground uh that'll be one that we work on in the near future I'll show you if you get knocked down how to get off the ground and keep fighting so those are basic things if you need your own and you're allowed to have one of these check the the link in the description below you can you can buy one of these online they're like 30 40 bucks you can get a good pair of Collie sticks or scam sticks they're in there too start with rettin start with lightweight wood learn how to fight with sticks stick fighting training for self-defense is simple because you can find sticks wherever you are you might not have the sticks that you bought from the website with you or that you use in your martial arts class with you but you'll take the skill of stick fighting with you wherever you go because it's in here and it's in your hands whether you have this with you or not and then I promise you please if you help me uh can help me out because this will help every body put in the comment section what sticks do you find daily in your environment so when you go through today take notes come back to this video what sticks did you see and and I'll try to do that too maybe I that's what we'll do next week I'll walk around and I'll show all the sticks that I can find uh Christina asked how often do I do classes right now I'm on the injured reserve list so that means I'm just doing classes in the garage for you online um I try to do two or three a week and then once I we get the school back open after I get my other hip replacement done which looks like it's going to be toward the end of the year then we'll open the studio back up and then I usually have classes six days a week and I try to be online six days a week um yeah donut Lords want uh bow staff fighting um a video if I can find somebody who knows how to fight with a bow staff I'd love to do that I was thinking about that that's funny you said that I was think about that this week that um I miss fighting I miss hitting things cuz I don't have any bags anymore I open it too hard and I miss uh I don't have they're all in storage and I miss um sparring with people both with I like fighting with the sticks and I like fighting with um the bow staff and all the different staffs and I like sword fighting I think sword fighting keeps you sharp here um so we'll do that we'll try to make some videos of that coming up soon and I'll show you how to fight with staffs and not just taping stash together cuz that's funny and that's a good practice tapping them together but um you have to be able to defend yourself with it so we'll do some of that and then we'll talk about like one weapon against another weapon anyway you guys have been awesome again if you need one of these thank you so much Christina for being here thanks for everybody for being here you need one of these or a pair of extremist sticks please check the description below and then in the comment section leave us some notes and then comment on
