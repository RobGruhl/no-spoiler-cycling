Please like, subscribe, and leave me comments!\n\nGo to pasquinilli.com to get updates and curriculum checklists and guides.\n\nsticks or also known as Ki sticks our knee sticks we're going to use sticks to defend ourselves and you can train with a pair of sticks like this or even just one stick learn how to defend yourself fighting with sticks and then you can find sticks anywhere we're also going to talk about the expand over baton which is almost exactly the same length as a traditional collie or a screa stick I put links in the description below if you want to see what the dimensions are so you're going to start with one if you have two you're going to start with two one in each hand you have one just start with one and as a warmup I want you to just swing them so that you can warm up your shoulders all of these strikes are going to come off of the shoulder or through the Shoulder Through the elbow through the wrist and the joints through all of this we want to warm it up first you're just going to do this basic swinging motion that's going to get your heart rate up a little bit pump the blood get the sovial fluid into the joints warming up so you stay safe from injury now when you fight there's no time to warm up you're just going to hit the guy for self-defense smashing but in practice when you're learning how to do stick fighting for self-defense when you do stick fighting training you need a good proper warm up to stay safe from injury we're going to start to move fast hit hard sometimes you'll hit maybe like a stack of tires a pole a tree a punching bag and then you want to keep those joints safe from injury so that you can hit harder and harder and move faster for self-defense one of the great things about these sticks is it gives you reach Advantage you get somebody coming around attacking you with a bladed weapon something like this maybe a little longer a little shorter either thrusting or slashing and you have one of these poles which is usually one of these fighting sticks about as long as your arm your entire arm you can hit him before he can hit you so you have the advantage of reach and we're going to talk about how to defend against a blade here in a second the second warm up move before we get into the strikes is turning hello Doug good to see you Doug says Canada approves of what's going on this morning I myself I'm starting to feel un burdened by what has been just a little election day po post elction humor but as you do this motion keep your hand closed and you're going to rotate out you rotate in and out and all that's doing is warming your wrists up up it's going to build power in your grip so that when you strike for self-defense you're going to be able to hold on to it better after you do that spinning warm up go back to the swinging and then you're going to spin down and spin up we're not going to go into all of the traditional Filipino martial arts FMA that you might do all the moves something called Cali which is kind of a weeding pattern you can learn this this will help break up the monotony of training with your strikes but really for a warm up all you need is this spinning motion and Swinging swinging and spinning to build power in all of your basic strikes for self fense you can do it going down and up you can do it going forward I'll slow down a lot you see all I'm doing is turning out turning in you can then alternate that doing one hand at a Time come forward miss the comment go put it up again and then if you want you can do it at the same time and that's just a look fancy that's not you're going to use that in a fight when you start doing stick fighting training not everything has to be a self-defense move think about a boxer who skips rope or hits the speed bag or hits the the punching bag the boxer doesn't take any of those tools with him into the boxing ring in the same way you're not going to necessarily fight with this this motion but that's kind of like cross training with like a boxer it's going to get your heart rate up it's going to uh build timing and distance speed and power increase the speed of your strikes sometimes you can add a spin and then make your strike a lot faster so you will use it but we're going to start with these um mrgs about these sticks particularly there is a link in the description to um a martial arts store that has a lot of different kinds of esrea sticks these uh sticks specifically are not made anymore so but I think you can get a version of them the company that makes these are combative K MB a ti.com and they make a lot of they have a lot of gnarly knives over there too they make a lot of like expandable baton they have a lot of not expandable baton but like um a lot of fancy tools like this this always reminded me of kind of like the Daredevil but that's the basic warmup I want you to do I'm going to put these down and show you how we're going to use them for self fence because that's really what we're talking about we're not talking about traditional uh learning a traditional martial art we're talking about practicing hitting someone stick fighting for self-defense stick fight training so from here starting in either hand doesn't matter because you're going to do both hands with the same number of strikes I'm going to start here in in my right you can do right or left if it's in your right put your right foot forward if it's in your left put your left foot forward you're going to make yourself a smaller Target you're always going to fight from behind these sticks so the stick is between you and the thread remember that never having any wide strikes these wide strikes are not going to work CU he'll close the distance and you'll wrap your arm around them you'll it barely hit them at all if if if you do hit him but if you're coming from the shoulder and you're fighting and you're keeping that stick between you and him he has to get through your stick so you're going to hit him you're going to go into him um yeah klie esrea arnice are all you know three different names sakal you can find it under Sall s i k l salot s i l all from the Filipino martial arts the diaspora of the mo he K Kingdom which was more you know so Indonesia um all over Asia you'll find about this length of a stick sticks and knives and they do you know when the the knife comes out of your hand the stick comes out of your hand they also do a lot of hand to hand a lot of Filipino martial arts also use a lot of je do you'll see a lot of Bruce Lee style in there so the first thing you have to see here is you're going to choke up a little bit and that's so that you have this ability to catch strip you can strip his weapon out of his hand you can catch and trap his hand you can also strike with it Christina asked uh wood or metal which is better it's personal preference if I like I like wood to start um especially retan which isn't technically wood it's grass and um rtin are what you'll find the most if you check the link below in the description and that store or I think most of them are retan there are some that are Hardwoods but go light because you want to get your techniques really fast and clean and then you want to learn how to hit and Ran's not going to break so you want to be able to um train with a stick and then use any stick so this is the whole point of stick fighting training is not necessarily to carry if I carry these walking down the street in an urban area I look like a threat right you might be able to stash him in a backpack like you're one of the Ninja Turtles or Daredevil or whatever or you might be in a situation where something happens you need to defend yourself and your family and there's sticks in your environment and you have to think outside the box not a wood stick that fell off of a tree although that might be what it is it might be you're at the gas station and there's that stick that you use to clean the windshield off with the squeegee on one side and the sponge on the other side it might be that you're in a restaurant and there's um in the kitchen there are spatulas and tongs and big spoons that are all longer maybe not this long but almost as long made out of metal or made out of wood that you can use to defend yourself you might break off the leg of a wooden chair or a table you might um be at the beach you might have an umbrella with you that's about this this long or a little longer or a little shorter you if it's one of those expandable ones you can extend it then you have some striking then it's going to break but it's better than nothing especially if he pulls out a weapon a knife but there sticks everywhere and let's do this let's put in the comment section not just the the chat but in the comment section put in the sticks that you can think of in your daily environment where I work there are I work on a campus lots of different buildings every building I go into every room I look around and I find at least two or three sticks that I would pick up and if I had to defend myself with a stick I also carry openly because of my job I'm security so I carry um I also have a blade on me all the time I also have a couple other tools that we won't go into but then I know how to fight with sticks I know how to fight with any length of sticks and I want you to learn how to fight too all right so from here you choke up a little bit that gives you more striking surface the first thing that I want you to practice is this coming off off your shoulder think of striking Temple to his jaw or the clavicle through his ribs or maybe his uh ribs through the outside of his hip but coming through at that basic angle and you can strike his Temple you strike his jaw you his hand is holding that knife or he's punching he's choking you can break his bones and his hand you can smash that hand you can break his elbow you can smash his ribs you go down to his knees maybe it's a vicious animal attacking your dog and you can strike down into his face into his his nose or whatever so you have all these off of this basic first angle first angle is off the same shoulder second angle is off the other shoulder so those are the first two angles in which you practice you put them together now you're making this V and then you just practice over and over for a good 30 seconds or more and each time going faster and hitting harder so that when you need it you've already done it you've already hit hard and fast and then later once you find a surface to strike then that adds another dimension because then you're going to get the rebound effect where it bounces when in your hand and you're going to learn how to control that so coming off that shoulder striking down the next set or coming up at an angle think rib to clavicle or jaw to Temple coming up this way and Palm is facing the sky so that when you run into his body for self-defense it goes through your hand and doesn't come out good morning G Carlton if your hands facing the wrong way your palms down it's going to strip it popping your fingers right off just like that so from here you're coming straight up this way and then the opposite hip coming off then you're going to put those four together so down two up two angle one angle two angle three four coming down and coming up always keeping the stick between you and your opponent then on the other side coming down coming up because we want to do both sides evenly and like before starting to increase the speed and the power in each strike and making sure that you're keeping them tight you're coming back to your shoulders and you're coming off your hips and and then the next two coming straight across Temple jaw body hand ribs stomach knees but a horizontal strike and then back coming the other way Palm up Palm down cross the body and back put those together one two three four five six and then we're going to add seven coming straight down cracking them on top of it always head for selfdefense um with your stick stick fighting training so a vertical strike you can also do a vertical strike coming straight up so don't hit yourself in the face so we have two down two up to horizontal vertical down vertical up or instead of vertical up I like to add a jabbing motion coming up into his throat into his jaw into his nose into his solar plexus coming up this way by the way I know and you ask me this from time to time if you wanted to train with a tool like this you can practice those same basic angles with one of these so I'm not going to do a video specifically on this but if you also carry one of these you can basically you can do you do the same thing with this one now you can see there are other other angles that you can you can do with one of these that you might not do with these but you can it's all basic Stripes um and if you want if you want to go back and slow that down a little bit I'm trying to beat the algorithm and not get demonetized based on techniques with that tool so think down two up two across back down and then up and this this slap that you'll see a lot of Filipino guys Filipino martial arts guys do um it's uh it's two things it it it helps them when they start when you start do trapping it also if you're fighting with one of these will help you get the knife back out um just FY just for your information all right now after those basic strikes and you practice those I want you to think about this holding with two hands that you're doing a push-up and smashing especially this hard piece of metal this is aircraft aluminum you can be metal wood it doesn't matter because you're going against soft tissue you're going against his nose his teeth you're moving him back once you move him back you can box the ears because by grabbing it here you've closed that Loop and you have more leverage so you can strike here I want you to also think Irish shalele style twisting striking fast it's a fast explosive strike coming off of both sides you can see once you start to add the turn of your shoulders you're going to get more distance you're going to hit him farther away or you're going to go through him more and it's going to increase the power and the speed of that strike seeing how close I can get to the camera before I break my phone um Renee Rene ask what if he grab stick don't let him grab his stick Renee but if he does get your other hand on it right away and twist and then push if he's pulling on your stick he's pulling it back this way you let him have it literally by moving forward toward him and then wherever you have your hands if his hands in the middle and you can grab on the other side twist like that then either push down and when you do this use your whole body so that you're engaging the big core muscles against his arm muscles and his shoulder muscles you want your big muscles against his little muscles so you're pushing down you can also push up by turning your hips and maybe just maybe you'll smash them on the bottom of his his jaw his tongue will be there bite his tongue off or smash his teeth break his teeth out of his face for self- offense and then push coming through his throat or throwing through his face um once I reopen the school after I get my other hip replaced I'll have a partner and I'll show you what that looks like when someone grabs it I'll have him grab it I'll grab his and I'll show you that you know even if I'm bigger than he is I'm assuming that I'll be bigger but maybe he'll beer I don't know uh depending on who we get to do that you can still apply these basic principles of twisting or turning and pushing turning lifting coming up this way and it's simply because you're you're not fighting him where he's fighting if he's pulling and you're trying to pull back and he's stronger than you you're going to lose you're getting a tug of war your body's shaking if he's pulling back and you're giving it to him and you turning at the same time now all of a sudden his energy is coming this way he's not resisting that and you have to move fast cuz he will resist as soon as he feels it then you can drop it raking down his face and then jab him with two hands up under his chin or push and smash his teeth from this position holding two hands pushing boxing twisting that hand smacking really hard also holding this with a a little bit here on the bottom we have these basic strikes that we went over also jab straight in think of a reverse jab he's behind you smash here you can smash and push hit his groin smash his knee hit him in the jaw smash the side of his head with the length uh this is silent wild gas is that this aluminum this one is aluminum here's its partner so you can hear I think they're they're Hollow but then they have caps on the on the end it's uh aircraft grade is what I was told but again this comes from combative KB a.com um if you want a link my my uh what I would suggest you do at the beginning when I first got these they cut me up a lot because they weren't um they weren't properly you know they were they were uh really sharp so I've dled the just by using them with my rough skin over time but I would recommend retan R A TT an I think and there's a link in the description to rettin also the next one that I want to show you which is one of my [Music] favorites just because you see him everywhere these days we might see him in the next few days pop out with some bad characters using them uh law enforcement most of law enforcement guys I know they won't they won't pull these out anymore if they do carry them I was talk the guy the guys I work with every day none of them carry them at all but this is the expandable baton and it's the exact same length or close to it yeah I think it's the same length as the colli or Screaming stick and col and scre sticks can come in different lengths like 26 28 24 if you're a kid they have teen which are thinner and then they have the larger if you're an adult um it really doesn't matter what stick you start with but the expandable baton is the same length as the extremist stick and you can carry it concealed and S Christina ask why don't the police use them some police still do but a lot of them don't use them because of all of the cameras all the defund the police all of the animosity that has been just heaped onto our law enforcement they don't want to lose their home they don't some of them I've talked to some people in certain departments I won't mention which ones they are locally who say we don't get out of the car anymore unless someone actively calls us we don't Patrol like we used to to have a presence because we don't want to be the next news story because we're doing our jobs and then it's misinterpreted or it's uh taken advantage of by the media to make us look like the bad guys and so they won't use these because to use them effectively it's a lot of this against somebody who's resisting arrest so they use either a taser or they have they use their firearm and so a lot more people are getting hurt just because of the way we've treated law enforcement we being the society um yeah Renee says maybe that'll change soon and I agree let's hope so let's hope that we can cuz I talk to these guys every day and they are facing like the department I work with with they are undermanned every Department that I talk to around here and this is an area I'm in Florida where there's a lot of support for law enforcement and it's not just the defund movements that has pulled so many people out it's this whole demographic shift where a lot of people retiring kids aren't coming into the profession and it doesn't pay enough the rent here for like a one bedroom is 2500 bucks a starting cop can make 60 Grand that's not enough money to pay for it and you know you can't live and how can you be a grown man or a grown woman protecting and and serving putting your life on the line and you can't afford to live that's ridiculous but anyway so it's a lot of different factors and um the bottom line is you need to be your own first responder being able to defend yourself with sticks that's why we do stick fighting training for self-defense so with this stick and I'm going to go over it simply it's it's the same moves as the collie stick that's why I said you can or the scream of stick you can learn to fight with any stick pick up a stick you can carry in certain places you have to check the laws in your area whe you this some places you need a conceal carry permit I have one of those I'm also in an open or a permitless state where you don't need one but to carry one of these you can stuff this in a bag you can put it on your shirt put it in a pocket when it's closed to close them you have to hit them on a hard surface to break the friction there are two kinds this is the friction kind the other kind is like springloaded you hit a button and pops out hit a button pops back in I've only ever used springloaded I don't know how or um friction style I don't know how the other ones work I mean I know how they work in principle I don't know if they're as good as I like this one but you have this um Christine ask is it not legal to carry it's not legal to carry in certain places I'm pretty sure you can't carry this in Canada at all you but you can't carry this in Canada if you can open it with one hand it's not legal um oh Christina says she's in uh security she doesn't have a firearm so you have to get creative yeah in order to defend yourself because some security are there just to pay attention and then call law enforcement in but that doesn't mean that when you call law enforcement the guy's not going to close the distance and start to hurt you while you're waiting for the police to respond 3 to 4 minutes later and yeah they get there but by then it might be too late so this is something you can use or like I said you can find other sticks in your environment that are the same length if they won't allow you to carry this so from here coming off the shoulder same exact angles as we trained with the other one you cannot do this because if you hit them with Force it's going to collapse and you're going to have a short stick again but you can can be closed and then Jam them with the the closed one and then pop it back open you can also pull it and smash him back but same thing as soon as Force hits this the vibrations enough it's going to start to collapse so as long as you know that you know it might collapse on you but you can do all the boxing you can do the rolling of your hand you hit them with this side that's where all the weight is that's going to hit a lot harder than that side does but it's basically these techniques now there are come-along techniques come-along techniques are when you maybe twist his arm behind his back or you come up and you apply pressure and and twist but that's not what we're going over we're not law enforcement trying to apprehend we're just doing stick fighting training to defend ourselves against a thug or a punk or an aggressive person who is off out of their mind who's trying to take your life your dignity your freedom and we know that God gives us right to self-de defense so we're defending ourselves stick fighting training for self-defense that's why we do that but um to use this it's very simple and to get good at using it practice those basic angles and as long as you remember the general rule that you're going to fight from behind your stick and that all angles this angle might be to the head but it might also be to the body and it can also go down to the knee so when you do practice practice these angles super tight coming from your shoulder off your body never from out here if you swing out here and he closes the Gap your arm wraps around him and you never hit him if you come here and he closes that distance he runs right into your stick and you're going to hit him every time so always fight behind your stick stick practicing these angles once you practice one side practice the other side slow as smooth smooth as fast start slow and then gradually increase speed faster and faster and faster if you're on the ground with your stick Christina ask what you find yourself on the ground with the stick if uh this is one of he's coming in to you know run up and kick you in the face or stomp on your head you can use this to block that motion you can also from your back strike now you're not going to have as much strength this is something the Brazilian jiu-jitsu teaches is like the 10 points of uh contact I forget exactly how they say it but the idea that if you're standing on your feet and you can throw a punch or swing a stick you have the maximum amount of force that you can generate so their goal in Brazilian jiu-jitsu is to close the distance wrap you up take you to the ground and get you down to the point you've seen it where they're sitting on top of somebody and all they have is their wrist left so they went from 10 to one this one little joint and you can't hurt somebody you know even if you got your hand closed you can annoy them but you're going to knock knock somebody out standing you anybody I can teach you how to knock somebody out I don't care how big or how small how young or how old you are I can teach almost anybody how to knock somebody out if they're standing on their feet and their timing and distan is right and you have to train a little bit but if you're on your on on your back now it's not likely you're going to be fighting a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt or even a blue belt or a purple belt it's more likely you're going to be fighting a crazed addict or um a road rage or uh enraged by what's happening in the world right now a crazy person or a a violent person who is getting paid to burn things to the ground because the people paying them yeah silent walk said some idiot on the bus got arrested because they had their their knife open and now everybody feels threatened there's the famous news story in New York right now where the young Marine uh former Marine defended himself and the others from a guy who threatened to kill everybody who was an addict and um he put him in a choke hold police got there he still had a pulse he still had a pulse for a long time he was still breathing and because he didn't he didn't break his neck he didn't uh uh you know crash his his throat and it's another one of those things where the guy doing the right thing is getting punished because the in that area they they want to punish the good guys and let the bad guys you know give the victims all the rights or the criminals all the rights anyway the question was what do you do if you're on the ground you can also smash his feet there are a lot of nerves in The Shins go for The Shins if you can hit him in the groin go for the groin if he's coming down to jump on top of you go for his face while you're on the back if you can get stay on you know on your back stay on your back and then you turn to the side um I've got a few videos on here where I show you how to get up from the ground uh that'll be one that we work on in the near future I'll show you if you get knocked down how to get off the ground and keep fighting so those are basic things if you need your own and you're allowed to have one of these check the the link in the description below you can you can buy one of these online they're like 30 40 bucks you can get a good pair of Collie sticks or scam sticks they're in there too start with rettin start with lightweight wood learn how to fight with sticks stick fighting training for self-defense is simple because you can find sticks wherever you are you might not have the sticks that you bought from the website with you or that you use in your martial arts class with you but you'll take the skill of stick fighting with you wherever you go because it's in here and it's in your hands whether you have this with you or not and then I promise you please if you help me uh can help me out because this will help every body put in the comment section what sticks do you find daily in your environment so when you go through today take notes come back to this video what sticks did you see and and I'll try to do that too maybe I that's what we'll do next week I'll walk around and I'll show all the sticks that I can find uh Christina asked how often do I do classes right now I'm on the injured reserve list so that means I'm just doing classes in the garage for you online um I try to do two or three a week and then once I we get the school back open after I get my other hip replacement done which looks like it's going to be toward the end of the year then we'll open the studio back up and then I usually have classes six days a week and I try to be online six days a week um yeah donut Lords want uh bow staff fighting um a video if I can find somebody who knows how to fight with a bow staff I'd love to do that I was thinking about that that's funny you said that I was think about that this week that um I miss fighting I miss hitting things cuz I don't have any bags anymore I open it too hard and I miss uh I don't have they're all in storage and I miss um sparring with people both with I like fighting with the sticks and I like fighting with um the bow staff and all the different staffs and I like sword fighting I think sword fighting keeps you sharp here um so we'll do that we'll try to make some videos of that coming up soon and I'll show you how to fight with staffs and not just taping stash together cuz that's funny and that's a good practice tapping them together but um you have to be able to defend yourself with it so we'll do some of that and then we'll talk about like one weapon against another weapon anyway you guys have been awesome again if you need one of these thank you so much Christina for being here thanks for everybody for being here you need one of these or a pair of extremist sticks please check the description below and then in the comment section leave us some notes and then comment on
