everyone so today I'm going to give you a couple tips on doing the club Mill if you're learning a club Mill some things you might need to know that will help I was trying to do this in the story but it was too long so I'm going to try and get this done in a minute and 30 so we can keep it in the reels okay so make sure when we're doing the club Mill okay that we keep the forearm arm angle at about 90° right that we hit those points as we move through the movement we don't usually stop once we're we're actually doing them we want to make sure we get to those points we also want to make sure the forearm is in the coronal or parallel to the coronal plane line which separates the front and the back so it's like 90° from the sagittal which separates your left and right okay so if it is off if it goes out or it goes in okay it's common to go in because it it feels like it becomes more stable but the problem is when we cast out now there's an angle and it's going to come here when we're when we're staying in the coronal plane line okay with our forearm when we rotate our torso our body is clear out of the way okay when we're rotating around all right again it won't come back and hit into us so we want to make sure that we're rotating our torso about 90° from that sadal plane line or parallel if I drew a line out of my sternum parallel with the chronal plane line anyway hopefully that helps if you have any questions stay strong I'll see you next time
