[Music] hi my name is trusa I'm a senior mayam and karakai coach and I've been teaching both mayam and karakai for almost six years now in this video I want to talk about an incorrect and quite an unproductive way of uh practicing with your karakai or mudar which I have been observing has become quite prevalent among the practitioners and that is focusing your training heavily on uh The Swinging function of Kai now there are two unproductive things that are happening here and I think I have discussed about this in one of my previous videos also while explaining about body rotation so the first thing is since your training is heavily focused on swinging you're constantly taking help of the momentum generated by swinging to move your klak and hence you are missing out on the essential part of the practice which is building muscular skeletal strength which is not going to come if your practice focuses heavily on swinging kakai the second thing that is going to happen and especially if you are a beginner it increases the chances of injuries so uh to give you a quick example if your practice of body rotation looks like this where you're swinging kakai heavily when your kakai reaches here if you do not have good neuromuscular coordination and strength then there is a possibility that you can lose control over the movement of karakai and that can cause injury to your shoulder elbow and wrist so just now we saw how these unproductive things are happening if your training is uh focused heavily uh on The Swinging function of kakati so now the question is what does a good training session look uh look like a good training session uh which combines uh mayam and karakai in an effective and intelligent way will train you on uh six basic human movement patterns there are actually seven uh essential human movement patterns which are push pull hinge lunge squat rotate and Locomotion now the seventh one Locomotion uh which includes walking and climbing now that is something that you can practice on your own separately but a good kagai training session will train you on these first six uh human movement patterns so that's how a good training session looks like and if you are interested in training correctly feel free to get in touch with us uh and join any of our uh online train training and if you are interested in teaching kagai properly then uh get in touch with me uh for the next teacher training course which is starting from 27th April so if you found this video useful please share it with other practitioners also and I will see you in the next video thank you [Music] n [Music]
