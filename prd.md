# Non-Spoiler Sports v2 - Product Requirements Document

**Version**: 2.0 MVP (Working Session Architecture)
**Date**: September 21, 2025
**Status**: Implementation Ready

## Executive Summary

Non-Spoiler Sports v2 MVP is a working session-driven cycling video discovery system where Claude Code handles all content discovery during live sessions with users, interpreting raw content and updating simple data files. The system delivers spoiler-free cycling content through a beautiful, static HTML presentation layer that requires no complex authentication or API calls.

## Core Vision

**"Working Sessions. Static Results. No Spoilers."**

Users work with Claude Code to discover cycling content during live sessions. Claude handles all the complex API work, interprets content intelligently, and generates updated static files. Users receive a self-contained HTML file that works perfectly offline with direct video links.

## Working Session Architecture

### Discovery & Presentation Separation
```
Working Session (Claude Code + User):
â”œâ”€â”€ User: "Find new Tour de France content"
â”œâ”€â”€ Claude: Firecrawl API calls with credential handling
â”œâ”€â”€ Claude: LLM interpretation and spoiler filtering
â”œâ”€â”€ Claude: Update race-metadata.json with discoveries
â””â”€â”€ Claude: Regenerate index.html with latest content

User Experience:
â””â”€â”€ Receives updated HTML file with latest racing content
    â”œâ”€â”€ Direct video links (click â†’ immediate play)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Steephill.tv-inspired design
    â”œâ”€â”€ Offline capable
    â””â”€â”€ No authentication needed
```

**Core Benefits**:
- **No browser authentication complexity**: Claude handles all API work during sessions
- **No rate limiting for users**: API calls happen during Claude sessions only
- **Fast, reliable HTML**: Static presentation with embedded styles
- **Offline capable**: Works without internet once generated

}
```

## Authentication Strategy

### Simplified Session Management
1. **Discovery Authentication** (Claude only):
   - Claude uses provided platform credentials during working sessions
   - No user authentication complexity
   - All API work happens server-side during sessions

2. **Video Access** (User experience):
   - Direct video links work with user's existing platform sessions
   - Users log into platforms normally in their browsers
   - No separate authentication flow needed
   - Graceful handling when sessions expire

3. **No Browser-Based API Calls**:
   - HTML file contains no authentication logic
   - No API keys exposed to users
   - No rate limiting concerns for end users
   - Complete separation of discovery and presentation
