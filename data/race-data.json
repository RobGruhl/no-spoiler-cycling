        "courseSummary": "The 2026 Australian Road National Championships moved to Perth, Western Australia for a three-year stint after two decades at Buninyong in Victoria. The 177km elite men's race covers 13 laps of a 13.6km circuit through Perth's CBD and the leafy Kings Park. Unlike Buninyong's defining single climb, Perth's course spreads the climbing over an uphill drag in the first half and punchy pinches in the final stages. The defining feature is Malcolm Street - dubbed 'Pedal Mafia Mountain' - a steep pinch that peaks just 400 metres before the finish line, making for an explosive finale on every lap.",

The event spent two decades on a fixed course near Ballarat, Victoria, with its race-shaping Buninyong climb becoming iconic. The 2025 move to Perth marked a new era, with a circuit format that rewards different rider characteristics than the climbing-heavy Buninyong course.",
        "watchNotes": "Watch for the Malcolm Street pinch on each lap - as fatigue builds through 13 laps, this explosive climb becomes increasingly selective. The Perth course proved more decisive than it appears on paper in 2025, with few opportunities to rest. The flat-ish final kilometers after Malcolm Street make it possible for a small group to stay away, but also allows sprinters to hang on if they survive the climb. Expect attacking racing from the Perth locals eager to perform in front of home fans."

This 6-stage race (including prologue) features two decisive mountain stages in the Adelaide Hills - Stage 2 on the feared Corkscrew Road and Stage 4 featuring the iconic triple ascent of Willunga Hill. The format creates multiple GC opportunities: the prologue establishes early gaps, Corkscrew Road on Stage 2 provides the first major test, and Willunga Hill typically decides the ochre jersey on Stage 4. The final stage now features a circuit finish rather than a traditional sprint, adding drama to the finale.",

The race has earned a reputation for unpredictability, often producing surprise winners and close finishes. Australian riders have historically performed well on home soil.",
        "watchNotes": "The Challambra Crescent climb 9km from the finish is where the race explodes. Watch for attacks on the steeper gradients - the climb isn't long but it's punchy enough to shed pure sprinters. Coastal winds throughout can cause echelons and surprise splits. The fast descent and run-in to the Geelong waterfront favors riders who can recover quickly from the climb effort."
